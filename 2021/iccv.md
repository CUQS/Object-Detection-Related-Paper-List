##### Entropy Maximization and Meta Classification for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chan_Entropy_Maximization_and_Meta_Classification_for_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_in_Semantic_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Deep neural networks (DNNs) for the semantic segmentation of images are usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This is in contrast to the ""open world"" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect so-called ""out-of-distribution"" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called ""meta classification"". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance, cutting down the number of detection errors by 52% when comparing the best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.

##### 4D-Net for Learned Multi-Modal Alignment
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Piergiovanni_4D-Net_for_Learned_Multi-Modal_Alignment_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We present 4D-Net, a 3D object detection approach, which utilizes 3D Point Cloud and RGB sensing information, both in time. We are able to incorporate the 4D information by performing a novel dynamic connection learning across various feature representations and levels of abstraction and by observing geometric constraints. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and strong baselines on the Waymo Open Dataset. 4D-Net is better able to use motion cues and dense image information to detect distant objects more successfully. We will open source the code.

##### Semantic Diversity Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Classification
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ben-Cohen_Semantic_Diversity_Learning_for_Zero-Shot_Multi-Label_Classification_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Training a neural network model for recognizing multiple labels associated with an image, including identifying unseen labels, is challenging, especially for images that portray numerous semantically diverse labels. As challenging as this task is, it is an essential task to tackle since it represents many real-world cases, such as image retrieval of natural images. We argue that using a single embedding vector to represent an image, as commonly practiced, is not sufficient to rank both relevant seen and unseen labels accurately. This study introduces an end-to-end model training for multi-label zero-shot learning that supports the semantic diversity of the images and labels. We propose to use an embedding matrix having principal embedding vectors trained using a tailored loss function. In addition, during training, we suggest up-weighting in the loss function image samples presenting higher semantic diversity to encourage the diversity of the embedding matrix. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method improves the zero-shot model's quality in tag-based image retrieval achieving SoTA results on several common datasets (NUS-Wide, COCO, Open Images).

##### Pyramid Vision Transformer: A Versatile Backbone for Dense Prediction Without Convolutions
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Pyramid_Vision_Transformer_A_Versatile_Backbone_for_Dense_Prediction_Without_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success in computer vision, this work investigates a simpler, convolution-free backbone network useful for many dense prediction tasks. Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP. We hope that PVT could serve as an alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions and facilitate future research.

-    The popular unsupervised video object segmentation methods fuse the RGB frame and optical flow via a two-stream network. However, they cannot handle the distracting noises in each input modality, which may vastly deteriorate the model performance. We propose to establish the correspondence between the input modalities while suppressing the distracting signals via optimal structural matching. Given a video frame, we extract the dense local features from the RGB image and optical flow, and treat them as two complex structured representations. The Wasserstein distance is then employed to compute the global optimal flows to transport the features in one modality to the other, where the magnitude of each flow measures the extent of the alignment between two local features. To plug the structural matching into a two-stream network for end-to-end training, we factorize the input cost matrix into small spatial blocks and design a differentiable long-short Sinkhorn module consisting of a long-distant Sinkhorn layer and a short-distant Sinkhorn layer. We integrate the module into a dedicated two-stream network and dub our model TransportNet. Our experiments show that aligning motion-appearance yields the state-of-the-art results on the popular video object segmentation datasets.

##### Pi-NAS: Improving Neural Architecture Search by Reducing Supernet Training Consistency Shift

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Peng_Pi-NAS_Improving_Neural_Architecture_Search_by_Reducing_Supernet_Training_Consistency_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Recently proposed neural architecture search (NAS) methods co-train billions of architectures in a supernet and estimate their potential accuracy using the network weights detached from the supernet. However, the ranking correlation between the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is incorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this ranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift, including feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as dynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The input distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects architecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter updates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps. The rapidly-changing parameter could not preserve architecture ranking. We address these two shifts simultaneously using a nontrivial supernet-\Pi model, called \Pi-NAS. Specifically, we employ a supernet-\Pi model that contains cross-path learning to reduce the feature consistency shift between different paths. Meanwhile, we adopt a novel nontrivial mean teacher containing negative samples to overcome parameter shift and model collision. Furthermore, our \Pi-NAS runs in an unsupervised manner, which can search for more transferable architectures. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and a wide range of downstream tasks (e.g., COCO 2017, ADE20K, and Cityscapes) demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our \Pi-NAS compared to supervised NAS.

##### Online Refinement of Low-Level Feature Based Activation Map for Weakly Supervised Object Localization

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xie_Online_Refinement_of_Low-Level_Feature_Based_Activation_Map_for_Weakly_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We present a two-stage learning framework for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). While most previous efforts rely on high-level feature based CAMs (Class Activation Maps), this paper proposes to localize objects using the low-level feature based activation maps. In the first stage, an activation map generator produces activation maps based on the low-level feature maps in the classifier, such that rich contextual object information is included in an online manner. In the second stage, we employ an evaluator to evaluate the activation maps predicted by the activation map generator. Based on this, we further propose a weighted entropy loss, an attentive erasing, and an area loss to drive the activation map generator to substantially reduce the uncertainty of activations between object and background, and explore less discriminative regions. Based on the low-level object information preserved in the first stage, the second stage model gradually generates a well-separated, complete, and compact activation map of object in the image, which can be easily thresholded for accurate localization. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets show that our framework surpasses previous methods by a large margin, which sets a new state-of-the-art for WSOL. Code will be available soon.

-    Tremendous progress has been made in visual representation learning, notably with the recent success of self-supervised contrastive learning methods. Supervised contrastive learning has also been shown to outperform its cross-entropy counterparts by leveraging labels for choosing where to contrast. However, there has been little work to explore the transfer capability of contrastive learning to a different domain. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the transferability of learned representations of different contrastive approaches for linear evaluation, full-network transfer, and few-shot recognition on 12 downstream datasets from different domains, and object detection tasks on MSCOCO and VOC0712. The results show that the contrastive approaches learn representations that are easily transferable to a different downstream task. We further observe that the joint objective of self-supervised contrastive loss with cross-entropy/supervised-contrastive loss leads to better transferability of these models over their supervised counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the representations learned from the contrastive approaches contain more low/mid-level semantics than cross-entropy models, which enables them to quickly adapt to a new task. Our codes and models will be publicly available to facilitate future research on transferability of visual representations.

##### Query Adaptive Few-Shot Object Detection With Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks

-    Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect never-seen objects using few examples. This field sees recent improvement owing to the meta-learning techniques by learning how to match between the query image and few-shot class examples, such that the learned model can generalize to few-shot novel classes. However, currently, most of the meta-learning-based methods perform parwise matching between query image regions (usually proposals) and novel classes separately, therefore failing to take into account multiple relationships among them. In this paper, we propose a novel FSOD model using heterogeneous graph convolutional networks. Through efficient message passing among all the proposal and class nodes with three different types of edges, we could obtain context-aware proposal features and query-adaptive, multiclass-enhanced prototype representations for each class, which could help promote the pairwise matching and improve final FSOD accuracy. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model, denoted as QA-FewDet, outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches on the PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO FSOD benchmarks under different shots and evaluation metrics.

##### The Road To Know-Where: An Object-and-Room Informed Sequential BERT for Indoor Vision-Language Navigation

-    Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to find a path to a remote location on the basis of natural-language instructions and a set of photo-realistic panoramas. Most existing methods take the words in the instructions and the discrete views of each panorama as the minimal unit of encoding. However, this requires a model to match different nouns (e.g., TV, table) against the same input view feature. In this work, we propose an object-informed sequential BERT to encode visual perceptions and linguistic instructions at the same fine-grained level, namely objects and words. Our sequential BERT also enables the visual-textual clues to be interpreted in light of the temporal context, which is crucial to multi-round VLN tasks. Additionally, we enable the model to identify the relative direction (e.g., left/right/front/back) of each navigable location and the room type (e.g., bedroom, kitchen) of its current and final navigation goal, as such information is widely mentioned in instructions implying the desired next and final locations. We thus enable the model to know-where the objects lie in the images, and to know-where they stand in the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness compared against several state-of-the-art methods on three indoor VLN tasks: REVERIE, NDH, and R2R.

##### Morphable Detector for Object Detection on Demand

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhao_Morphable_Detector_for_Object_Detection_on_Demand_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Many emerging applications of intelligent robots need to explore and understand new environments, where it is desirable to detect objects of novel categories on the fly with minimum online efforts. This is an object detection on demand (ODOD) task. It is challenging, because it is impossible to annotate large data on the fly, and the embedded systems are usually unable to perform back-propagation which is essential for training. Most existing few-shot detection methods are confronted here as they need extra training. We propose a novel morphable detector (MD), that simply "morphs"" some of its changeable parameters online estimated from the few samples, so as to detect novel categories without any extra training. The MD has two sets of parameters, one for the feature embedding and the other for category representation(called "prototypes""). Each category is associated with a hidden prototype to be learned by integrating the visual and semantic embeddings. The learning of the MD is based on the alternate learning of the feature embedding and the prototypes in an EM-like approach which allows the recovery of an unknown prototype from a few samples of a novel category. Once an MD is learned, it is able to use a few samples of a novel category to directly compute its prototype to fulfill the online morphing process. We have shown the superiority of the MD in Pascal, COCO and FSOD datasets.

##### Region-Aware Contrastive Learning for Semantic Segmentation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Hu_Region-Aware_Contrastive_Learning_for_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Recent works have made great success in semantic segmentation by exploiting contextual information in a local or global manner within individual image and supervising the model with pixel-wise cross entropy loss. However, from the holistic view of the whole dataset, semantic relations not only exist inside one single image, but also prevail in the whole training data, which makes solely considering intra-image correlations insufficient. Inspired by recent progress in unsupervised contrastive learning, we propose the region-aware contrastive learning (RegionContrast) for semantic segmentation in the supervised manner. In order to enhance the similarity of semantically similar pixels while keeping the discrimination from others, we employ contrastive learning to realize this objective. With the help of memory bank, we explore to store all the representative features into the memory. Without loss of generality, to efficiently incorporate all training data into the memory bank while avoiding taking too much computation resource, we propose to construct region centers to represent features from different categories for every image. Hence, the proposed region-aware contrastive learning is performed in a region level for all the training data, which saves much more memory than methods exploring the pixel-level relations. The proposed RegionContrast brings little computation cost during training and requires no extra overhead for testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO Stuff.

##### Exploring Classification Equilibrium in Long-Tailed Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Feng_Exploring_Classification_Equilibrium_in_Long-Tailed_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The conventional detectors tend to make imbalanced classification and suffer performance drop, when the distribution of the training data is severely skewed. In this paper, we propose to use the mean classification score to indicate the classification accuracy for each category during training. Based on this indicator, we balance the classification via an Equilibrium Loss (EBL) and a Memory-augmented Feature Sampling (MFS) method. Specifically, EBL increases the intensity of the adjustment of the decision boundary for the weak classes by a designed score-guided loss margin between any two classes. On the other hand, MFS improves the frequency and accuracy of the adjustments of the decision boundary for the weak classes through over-sampling the instance features of those classes. Therefore, EBL and MFS work collaboratively for finding the classification equilibrium in long-tailed detection, and dramatically improve the performance of tail classes while maintaining or even improving the performance of head classes. We conduct experiments on LVIS using Mask R-CNN with various backbones including ResNet-50-FPN and ResNet-101-FPN to show the superiority of the proposed method. It improves the detection performance of tail classes by 15.6 AP, and outperforms the most recent long-tailed object detectors by more than 1 AP.

##### Assignment-Space-Based Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Choudhuri_Assignment-Space-Based_Multi-Object_Tracking_and_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is important for understanding dynamic scenes in video data. Existing methods perform well on multi-object detection and segmentation for independent video frames, but tracking of objects over time remains a challenge. MOTS methods formulate tracking locally, i.e., frame-by-frame, leading to sub-optimal results. Classical global methods on tracking operate directly on object detections, which leads to a combinatorial growth in the detection space. In contrast, we formulate a global method for MOTS over the space of assignments rather than detections: First, we find all top-k assignments of objects detected and segmented between any two consecutive frames and develop a structured prediction formulation to score assignment sequences across any number of consecutive frames. We use dynamic programming to find the global optimizer of this formulation in polynomial time. Second, we connect objects which reappear after having been out of view for some time. For this we formulate an assignment problem. On the challenging KITTI-MOTS and MOTSChallenge datasets, this achieves state-of-the-art results among methods which don't use depth data.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhang_Spatially_Conditioned_Graphs_for_Detecting_Human-Object_Interactions_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We address the problem of detecting human-object interactions in images using graphical neural networks. Unlike conventional methods, where nodes send scaled but otherwise identical messages to each of their neighbours, we propose to condition messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships, resulting in different messages going to neighbours of the same node. To this end, we explore various ways of applying spatial conditioning under a multi-branch structure. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate the advantages of spatial conditioning for the computation of the adjacency structure, messages and the refined graph features. In particular, we empirically show that as the quality of the bounding boxes increases, their coarse appearance features contribute relatively less to the disambiguation of interactions compared to the spatial information. Our method achieves an mAP of 31.33% on HICO-DET and 54.2% on V-COCO, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art on fine-tuned detections.

##### G-DetKD: Towards General Distillation Framework for Object Detectors via Contrastive and Semantic-Guided Feature Imitation

-    In this paper, we investigate the knowledge distillation (KD) strategy for object detection and propose an effective framework applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous student-teacher pairs. The conventional feature imitation paradigm introduces imitation masks to focus on informative foreground areas while excluding the background noises. However, we find that those methods fail to fully utilize the semantic information in all feature pyramid levels, which leads to inefficiency for knowledge distillation between FPN-based detectors. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-guided feature imitation technique, which automatically performs soft matching between feature pairs across all pyramid levels to provide the optimal guidance to the student. To push the envelop even further, we introduce contrastive distillation to effectively capture the information encoded in the relationship between different feature regions. Finally, we propose a generalized detection KD pipeline, which is capable of distilling both homogeneous and heterogeneous detector pairs. Our method consistently outperforms the existing detection KD techniques, and works when (1) components in the framework are used separately and in conjunction; (2) for both homogeneous and heterogenous student-teacher pairs and (3) on multiple detection benchmarks. With a powerful X101-FasterRCNN-Instaboost detector as the teacher, R50-FasterRCNN reaches 44.0% AP, R50-RetinaNet reaches 43.3% AP and R50-FCOS reaches 43.1% AP on COCO dataset.

-    This work addresses the challenging task of LiDAR-based 3D object detection in foggy weather. Collecting and annotating data in such a scenario is very time, labor and cost intensive. In this paper, we tackle this problem by simulating physically accurate fog into clear-weather scenes, so that the abundant existing real datasets captured in clear weather can be repurposed for our task. Our contributions are twofold: 1) We develop a physically valid fog simulation method that is applicable to any LiDAR dataset. This unleashes the acquisition of large-scale foggy training data at no extra cost. These partially synthetic data can be used to improve the robustness of several perception methods, such as 3D object detection and tracking or simultaneous localization and mapping, on real foggy data. 2) Through extensive experiments with several state-of-the-art detection approaches, we show that our fog simulation can be leveraged to significantly improve the performance for 3D object detection in the presence of fog. Thus, we are the first to provide strong 3D object detection baselines on the Seeing Through Fog dataset. Our code is available at www.trace.ethz.ch/lidar_fog_simulation.

-    Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) enables finding an object using a dataset without any localization information. By simply training a classification model using only image-level annotations, the feature map of a model can be utilized as a score map for localization. In spite of many WSOL methods proposing novel strategies, there has not been any de facto standards about how to normalize the class activation map (CAM). Consequently, many WSOL methods have failed to fully exploit their own capacity because of the misuse of a normalization method. In this paper, we review many existing normalization methods and point out that they should be used according to the property of the given dataset. Additionally, we propose a new normalization method which substantially enhances the performance of any CAM-based WSOL methods. Using the proposed normalization method, we provide a comprehensive evaluation over three datasets (CUB, ImageNet and OpenImages) on three different architectures and observe significant performance gains over the conventional normalization methods in all the evaluated cases.

-    Semi-supervised video object segmentation is a task of segmenting the target object in a video sequence given only a mask annotation in the first frame. The limited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most previous best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or online inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative for similar instances or insufficient in the utilization of spatio-temporal information. In this work, we propose to integrate transductive and inductive learning into a unified framework to exploit the complementarity between them for accurate and robust video object segmentation. The proposed approach consists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a lightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues while the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain discriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a two-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for each of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be disentangled to better retain their complementarity. Extensive experiments on several prevalent benchmarks show that, without the need of synthetic training data, the proposed approach sets a series of new state-of-the-art records.

##### Salient Object Ranking With Position-Preserved Attention

-    Instance segmentation can detect where the objects are in an image, but hard to understand the relationship between them. We pay attention to a typical relationship, relative saliency. A closely related task, salient object detection, predicts a binary map highlighting a visually salient region while hard to distinguish multiple objects. Directly combining two tasks by post-processing also leads to poor performance. There is a lack of research on relative saliency at present, limiting the practical applications such as content-aware image cropping, video summary, and image labeling. In this paper, we study the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which manages to assign a ranking order of each detected object according to its visual saliency. We propose the first end-to-end framework of the SOR task and solve it in a multi-task learning fashion. The framework handles instance segmentation and salient object ranking simultaneously. In this framework, the SOR branch is independent and flexible to cooperate with different detection methods, so that easy to use as a plugin. We also introduce a Position-Preserved Attention (PPA) module tailored for the SOR branch. It consists of the position embedding stage and feature interaction stage. Considering the importance of position in saliency comparison, we preserve absolute coordinates of objects in ROI pooling operation and then fuse positional information with semantic features in the first stage. In the feature interaction stage, we apply the attention mechanism to obtain proposals' contextualized representations to predict their relative ranking orders. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the ASR dataset. Without bells and whistles, our proposed method outperforms the former state-of-the-art method significantly. The code will be released publicly available on https://github.com/EricFH/SOR.

-    We present DetCo, a simple yet effective self-supervised approach for object detection. Unsupervised pre-training methods have been recently designed for object detection, but they are usually deficient in image classification, or the opposite. Unlike them, DetCo transfers well on downstream instance-level dense prediction tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level classification accuracy. The advantages are derived from (1) multi-level supervision to intermediate representations, (2) contrastive learning between global image and local patches. These two designs facilitate discriminative and consistent global and local representation at each level of feature pyramid, improving detection and classification, simultaneously. Extensive experiments on VOC, COCO, Cityscapes, and ImageNet demonstrate that DetCo not only outperforms recent methods on a series of 2D and 3D instance-level detection tasks, but also competitive on image classification. For example, on ImageNet classification, DetCo is 6.9% and 5.0% top-1 accuracy better than InsLoc and DenseCL, which are two contemporary works designed for object detection. Moreover, on COCO detection, DetCo is 6.9 AP better than SwAV with Mask R-CNN C4. Notably, DetCo largely boosts up Sparse R-CNN, a recent strong detector, from 45.0 AP to 46.5 AP (+1.5 AP), establishing a new SOTA on COCO. Code is available.

-    We propose 3DETR, an end-to-end Transformer based object detection model for 3D point clouds. Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number of 3D-specific inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal modifications to the vanilla Transformer block. Specifically, we find that a standard Transformer with non-parametric queries and Fourier positional embeddings is competitive with specialized architectures that employ libraries of 3D-specific operators with hand-tuned hyperparameters. Nevertheless, 3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to implement, enabling further improvements by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%. Furthermore, we show 3DETR is applicable to 3D tasks beyond detection, and can serve as a building block for future research.

-    Knowledge distillation has become one of the most important model compression techniques by distilling knowledge from larger teacher networks to smaller student ones. Although great success has been achieved by prior distillation methods via delicately designing various types of knowledge, they overlook the functional properties of neural networks, which makes the process of applying those techniques to new tasks unreliable and non-trivial. To alleviate such problem, in this paper, we initially leverage Lipschitz continuity to better represent the functional characteristic of neural networks and guide the knowledge distillation process. In particular, we propose a novel Lipschitz Continuity Guided Knowledge Distillation framework to faithfully distill knowledge by minimizing the distance between two neural networks' Lipschitz constants, which enables teacher networks to better regularize student networks and improve the corresponding performance. We derive an explainable approximation algorithm with an explicit theoretical derivation to address the NP-hard problem of calculating the Lipschitz constant. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms other benchmarks over several knowledge distillation tasks (e.g., classification, segmentation and object detection) on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and PASCAL VOC datasets.

-    3D multi-object tracking in LiDAR point clouds is a key ingredient for self-driving vehicles. Existing methods are predominantly based on the tracking-by-detection pipeline and inevitably require a heuristic matching step for the detection association. In this paper, we present SimTrack to simplify the hand-crafted tracking paradigm by proposing an end-to-end trainable model for joint detection and tracking from raw point clouds. Our key design is to predict the first-appear location of each object in a given snippet to get the tracking identity and then update the location based on motion estimation. In the inference, the heuristic matching step can be completely waived by a simple read-off operation. SimTrack integrates the tracked object association, newborn object detection, and dead track killing in a single unified model. We conduct extensive evaluations on two large-scale datasets: nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset. Experimental results reveal that our simple approach compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods while ruling out the heuristic matching rules.

Although convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods have achieved great success, they only process one local neighborhood at a time and suffer from information loss on details caused by convolution and downsampling operators pooling and strided convolution).To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based object ReID framework named TransReID. Specifically, we first encode an image as a sequence of patches and build a transformer-based strong baseline with a few critical improvements, which achieves competitive results on several ReID benchmarks with CNN-based methods. To further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of transformers, two novel modules are carefully designed. (i) The jigsaw patch module (JPM) is proposed to rearrange the patch embeddings via shift and patch shuffle operations which generates robust features with improved discrimination ability and more diversified coverage. (ii) The side information embeddings (SIE) is introduced to mitigate feature bias towards camera/view variations by plugging in learnable embeddings to incorporate these non-visual clues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure transformer for ReID research. Experimental results of TransReID are superior promising, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle ReID benchmarks.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Meng_Foreground_Activation_Maps_for_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects with only image-level labels, which has better scalability and practicability than fully supervised methods in the actual deployment. However, with only image-level labels, learning object classification models tends to activate object parts and ignore the whole object, while expanding object parts into the whole object may deteriorate classification performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose foreground activation maps (FAM), whose aim is to optimize object localization and classification jointly via an object-aware attention module and a part-aware attention module in a unified model, where the two tasks can complement and enhance each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can achieve remarkable performance for both tasks by optimizing them jointly via FAM for WSOL. Besides, the designed two modules can effectively highlight foreground objects for localization and discover discriminative parts for classification. Extensive experiments with four backbones on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that our FAM performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOL methods.

-    Scene graph generation has emerged as an important problem in computer vision. While scene graphs provide a grounded representation of objects, their locations and relations in an image, they do so only at the granularity of proposal bounding boxes. In this work, we propose the first, to our knowledge, framework for pixel-level segmentation-grounded scene graph generation. Our framework is agnostic to the underlying scene graph generation method and address the lack of segmentation annotations in target scene graph datasets (e.g., Visual Genome) through transfer and multi-task learning from, and with, an auxiliary dataset (e.g., MS COCO). Specifically, each target object being detected is endowed with a segmentation mask, which is expressed as a lingual-similarity weighted linear combination over categories that have annotations present in an auxiliary dataset. These inferred masks, along with a Gaussian masking mechanism which grounds the relations at a pixel-level within the image, allow for improved relation prediction. The entire framework is end-to-end trainable and is learned in a multi-task manner.

-    Contrastive learning methods have significantly narrowed the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning on computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore their application to geo-located datasets, e.g. remote sensing, where unlabeled data is often abundant but labeled data is scarce. We first show that due to their different characteristics, a non-trivial gap persists between contrastive and supervised learning on standard benchmarks. To close the gap, we propose novel training methods that exploit the spatio-temporal structure of remote sensing data. We leverage spatially aligned images over time to construct temporal positive pairs in contrastive learning and geo-location to design pre-text tasks. Our experiments show that our proposed method closes the gap between contrastive and supervised learning on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation for remote sensing. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method can also be applied to geo-tagged ImageNet images, improving downstream performance on various tasks.

-    Motion blur caused by the moving of the object or camera during the exposure can be a key challenge for visual object tracking, affecting tracking accuracy significantly. In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object trackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack (ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural motion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers during the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation process. With this synthetic method, we propose optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA) by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate this issue, we further propose one-step ABA (OS-ABA) where we design and train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way. The experiments on four popular datasets (e.g., OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT) demonstrate that our methods are able to cause significant accuracy drops on four state-of-the-art trackers with high transferability.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Liu_Light_Field_Saliency_Detection_With_Dual_Local_Graph_Learning_and_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The application of light field data in salient object detection is becoming increasingly popular in recent years. The difficulty lies in how to effectively fuse the features within the focal stack and how to cooperate them with the feature of the all-focus image. Previous methods usually fuse focal stack features via convolution or ConvLSTM, which are both less effective and ill-posed. In this paper, we model the information fusion within focal stack via graph networks. They introduce powerful context propagation from neighbouring nodes and also avoid ill-posed implementations. On the one hand, we construct local graph connections thus avoiding prohibitive computational costs of traditional graph networks. On the other hand, instead of processing the two kinds of data separately, we build a novel dual graph model to guide the focal stack fusion process using all-focus patterns. To handle the second difficulty, previous methods usually implement one-shot fusion for focal stack and all-focus features, hence lacking a thorough exploration of their supplements. We introduce a reciprocative guidance scheme and enable mutual guidance between these two kinds of information at multiple steps. As such, both kinds of features can be enhanced iteratively, finally benefiting the saliency prediction. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed models are all beneficial and we achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods.

-    We present QueryInst, a new perspective for instance segmentation. QueryInst is a multi-stage end-to-end system that treats instances of interest as learnable queries, enabling query based object detectors, e.g., Sparse R-CNN, to have strong instance segmentation performance. The attributes of instances such as categories, bounding boxes, instance masks, and instance association embeddings are represented by queries in a unified manner. In QueryInst, a query is shared by both detection and segmentation via dynamic convolutions and driven by parallelly-supervised multi-stage learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO, CityScapes, and YouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in object detection, instance segmentation, and video instance segmentation tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a simple end-to-end query based framework can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in various instance-level recognition tasks.

-    Category-level 6D object pose estimation aims to predict the position and orientation for unseen objects, which plays a pillar role in many scenarios such as robotics and augmented reality. The significant intra-class variation is the bottleneck challenge in this task yet remains unsolved so far. In this paper, we take advantage of category prior to overcome this problem by innovating a structure-guided prior adaptation scheme to accurately estimate 6D pose for individual objects. Different from existing prior-based methods, given one object and its corresponding category prior, we propose to leverage their structure similarity to dynamically adapt the prior to the observed object. The prior adaptation intrinsically associates the adopted prior with different objects, from which we can accurately reconstruct the 3D canonical model of the specific object for pose estimation. To further enhance the structure characteristic of objects, we extract low-rank structure points from the dense object point cloud, therefore more efficiently incorporating sparse structural information during prior adaptation. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25 and REAL275 benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvement. Project homepage: https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/ kaichen/projects/sgpa/sgpa.html.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Cheng_On_Equivariant_and_Invariant_Learning_of_Object_Landmark_Representations_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Given a collection of images, humans are able to discover landmarks by modeling the shared geometric structure across instances. This idea of geometric equivariance has been widely used for the unsupervised discovery of object landmark representations. In this paper, we develop a simple and effective approach by combining instance-discriminative and spatially-discriminative contrastive learning. We show that when a deep network is trained to be invariant to geometric and photometric transformations, representations emerge from its intermediate layers that are highly predictive of object landmarks. Stacking these across layers in a "hypercolumn" and projecting them using spatially-contrastive learning further improves their performance on matching and few-shot landmark regression tasks. We also present a unified view of existing equivariant and invariant representation learning approaches through the lens of contrastive learning, shedding light on the nature of invariances learned. Experiments on standard benchmarks for landmark learning, as well as a new challenging one we propose, show that the proposed approach surpasses prior state-of-the-art.

##### Image Synthesis From Layout With Locality-Aware Mask Adaption

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Li_Image_Synthesis_From_Layout_With_Locality-Aware_Mask_Adaption_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    This paper is concerned with synthesizing images conditioned on a layout (a set of bounding boxes with object categories). Existing works construct a layout-mask-image pipeline. Object masks are generated separately and mapped to bounding boxes to form a whole semantic segmentation mask (layout-to-mask), with which a new image is generated (mask-to-image). However, overlapped boxes in layouts result in overlapped object masks, which reduces the mask clarity and causes confusion in image generation. We hypothesize the importance of generating clean and semantically clear semantic masks. The hypothesis is supported by the finding that the performance of state-of-the-art LostGAN decreases when input masks are tainted. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose Locality-Aware Mask Adaption (LAMA) module to adapt overlapped or nearby object masks in the generation. Experimental results show our proposed model with LAMA outperforms existing approaches regarding visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. On COCO-stuff in 256x256, our method improves the state-of-the-art FID score from 41.65 to 31.12 and the SceneFID from 22.00 to 18.64.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Luo_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptive_3D_Detection_With_Multi-Level_Consistency_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Deep learning-based 3D object detection has achieved unprecedented success with the advent of large-scale autonomous driving datasets. However, drastic performance degradation remains a critical challenge for cross-domain deployment. In addition, existing 3D domain adaptive detection methods often assume prior access to the target domain annotations, which is rarely feasible in the real world. To address this challenge, we study a more realistic setting, unsupervised 3D domain adaptive detection, which only utilizes source domain annotations. 1) We first comprehensively investigate the major underlying factors of the domain gap in 3D detection. Our key insight is that geometric mismatch is the key factor of domain shift. 2) Then, we propose a novel and unified framework, Multi-Level Consistency Network (MLC-Net), which employs a teacher-student paradigm to generate adaptive and reliable pseudo-targets. MLC-Net exploits point-, instance- and neural statistics-level consistency to facilitate cross-domain transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLC-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods (including those using additional target domain information) on standard benchmarks. Notably, our approach is detector-agnostic, which achieves consistent gains on both single- and two-stage 3D detectors. Code will be released.

-    Recently, directly detecting 3D objects from 3D point clouds has received increasing attention. To extract object representation from an irregular point cloud, existing methods usually take a point grouping step to assign the points to an object candidate so that a PointNet-like network could be used to derive object features from the grouped points. However, the inaccurate point assignments caused by the hand-crafted grouping scheme decrease the performance of 3D object detection.  In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for directly detecting 3D objects from the 3D point cloud. Instead of grouping local points to each object candidate, our method computes the feature of an object from all the points in the point cloud with the help of an attention mechanism in the Transformers, where the contribution of each point is automatically learned in the network training. With an improved attention stacking scheme, our method fuses object features in different stages and generates more accurate object detection results. With few bells and whistles, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance on two widely used benchmarks, ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D.

##### DAE-GAN: Dynamic Aspect-Aware GAN for Text-to-Image Synthesis

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ruan_DAE-GAN_Dynamic_Aspect-Aware_GAN_for_Text-to-Image_Synthesis_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Text-to-image synthesis refers to generating an image from a given text description, the key goal of which lies in photo realism and semantic consistency. Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence embedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the significant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in the text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a particular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly helpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of aspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Aspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively from multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and aspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a novel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an Attended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement (ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to globally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs aspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective. Finally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the text-image semantic consistency at different levels. Extensive experiments on two well-studied and publicly available datasets (i.e., CUB-200 and COCO) demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our method.

-    The existing active learning methods select the samples by evaluating the sample's uncertainty or its effect on the diversity of labeled datasets based on different task-specific or model-specific criteria. In this paper, we propose the Influence Selection for Active Learning(ISAL) which selects the unlabeled samples that can provide the most positive Influence on model performance. To obtain the Influence of the unlabeled sample in the active learning scenario, we design the Untrained Unlabeled sample Influence Calculation(UUIC) to estimate the unlabeled sample's expected gradient with which we calculate its Influence. To prove the effectiveness of UUIC, we provide both theoretical and experimental analyses. Since the UUIC just depends on the model gradients, which can be obtained easily from any neural network, our active learning algorithm is task-agnostic and model-agnostic. ISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance in different active learning settings for different tasks with different datasets. Compared with previous methods, our method decreases the annotation cost at least by 12%, 13% and 16% on CIFAR10, VOC2012 and COCO, respectively.

-    Transformer architectures have become the model of choice in natural language processing and are now being introduced into computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, in the field of human pose estimation, convolutional architectures still remain dominant. In this work, we present PoseFormer, a purely transformer-based approach for 3D human pose estimation in videos without convolutional architectures involved. Inspired by recent developments in vision transformers, we design a spatial-temporal transformer structure to comprehensively model the human joint relations within each frame as well as the temporal correlations across frames, then output an accurate 3D human pose of the center frame. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method on two popular and standard benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments show that PoseFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Our code and model will be publicly available.

-    Self-supervised representation learning is able to learn semantically meaningful features; however, much of its recent success relies on multiple crops of an image with very few objects. Instead of learning view-invariant representation from simple images, humans learn representations in a complex world with changing scenes by observing object movement, deformation, pose variation, and ego motion. Motivated by this ability, we present a new self-supervised learning representation framework that can be directly deployed on a video stream of complex scenes with many moving objects. Our framework features a simple flow equivariance objective that encourages the network to predict the features of another frame by applying a flow transformation to the features of the current frame. Our representations, learned from high-resolution raw video, can be readily used for downstream tasks on static images. Readout experiments on challenging semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection benchmarks show that we are able to outperform representations obtained from previous state-of-the-art methods including SimCLR and BYOL.

-    In this paper, we present Co-scale conv-attentional image Transformers (CoaT), a Transformer-based image classifier equipped with co-scale and conv-attentional mechanisms. First, the co-scale mechanism maintains the integrity of Transformers' encoder branches at individual scales, while allowing representations learned at different scales to effectively communicate with each other; we design a series of serial and parallel blocks to realize the co-scale mechanism. Second, we devise a conv-attentional mechanism by realizing a relative position embedding formulation in the factorized attention module with an efficient convolution-like implementation. CoaT empowers image Transformers with enriched multi-scale and contextual modeling capabilities. On ImageNet, relatively small CoaT models attain superior classification results compared with similar-sized convolutional neural networks and image/vision Transformers. The effectiveness of CoaT's backbone is also illustrated on object detection and instance segmentation, demonstrating its applicability to downstream computer vision tasks.

-    We present RePOSE, a fast iterative refinement method for 6D object pose estimation. Prior methods perform refinement by feeding zoomed-in input and rendered RGB images into a CNN and directly regressing an update of a refined pose. Their runtime is slow due to the computational cost of CNN, which is especially prominent in multiple-object pose refinement. To overcome this problem, RePOSE leverages image rendering for fast feature extraction using a 3D model with a learnable texture. We call this deep texture rendering, which uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to directly regress a view-invariant image representation of an object. Furthermore, we utilize differentiable Levenberg-Marquard (LM) optimization to refine a pose fast and accurately by minimizing the feature-metric error between the input and rendered image representations without the need of zooming in. These image representations are trained such that differentiable LM optimization converges within few iterations. Consequently, RePOSE runs at 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset - a 4.1% absolute improvement over the prior art, and comparable result on the YCB-Video dataset with a much faster runtime.

-    We propose UniT, a Unified Transformer model to simultaneously learn the most prominent tasks across different domains, ranging from object detection to natural language understanding and multimodal reasoning. Based on the transformer encoder-decoder architecture, our UniT model encodes each input modality with an encoder and makes predictions on each task with a shared decoder over the encoded input representations, followed by task-specific output heads. The entire model is jointly trained end-to-end with losses from each task. Compared to previous efforts on multi-task learning with transformers, we share the same model parameters across all tasks instead of separately fine-tuning task-specific models and handle a much higher variety of tasks across different domains. In our experiments, we learn 7 tasks jointly over 8 datasets, achieving strong performance on each task with significantly fewer parameters. Our code is available in MMF at https://mmf.sh.

-    Despite exciting progress in pre-training for visual-linguistic (VL) representations, very few aspire to a small VL model. In this paper, we study knowledge distillation(KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large VL model into a small VL model. The major challenge arises from the inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs, the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the intermediate representations. Specifically, we use the mean square error loss to mimic the attention distribution inside the transformer block and present a token-wise noise contrastive loss to align the hidden state by contrasting with negative representations stored in a sample queue. To this end, we show that our proposed distillation significantly improves the performance of small VL models on image captioning and visual question answering tasks. It reaches 120.8 in CIDEr score on COCO captioning, an improvement of 5.1 over its non-distilled counterpart; and an accuracy of 69.8 on VQA 2.0, a 0.8 gain from the baseline. Our extensive experiments and ablations confirm the effective-ness of VL distillation in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages.

-    Appearance and motion are two important sources of information in video object segmentation (VOS). Previous methods mainly focus on using simplex solutions, lowering the upper bound of feature collaboration among and across these two cues. In this paper, we study a novel framework, termed the FSNet (Full-duplex Strategy Network), which designs a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to achieve the bidirectional message propagation across embedding subspaces. Furthermore, the bidirectional purification module (BPM) is introduced to update the inconsistent features between the spatial-temporal embeddings, effectively improving the model robustness. By considering the mutual restraint within the full-duplex strategy, our FSNet performs the cross-modal feature-passing (i.e., transmission and receiving) simultaneously before the fusion and decoding stage, making it robust to various challenging scenarios (e.g., motion blur, occlusion) in VOS. Extensive experiments on five popular benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS16, FBMS, MCL, SegTrack-V2, and DAVSOD19) show that our FSNet outperforms other state-of-the-arts for both the VOS and video salient object detection tasks.

-    We address the problem of domain generalizable object detection, which aims to learn a domain-invariant detector from multiple "seen" domains so that it can generalize well to other "unseen" domains. The generalization ability is crucial in practical scenarios especially when it is difficult to collect data. Compared to image classification, domain generalization in object detection has seldom been explored with more challenges brought by domain gaps on both image and instance levels. In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable object detection model, termed Domain-Invariant Disentangled Network (DIDN). In contrast to directly aligning multiple sources, we integrate a disentangled network into Faster R-CNN. By disentangling representations on both image and instance levels, DIDN is able to learn domain-invariant representations that are suitable for generalized object detection. Furthermore, we design a cross-level representation reconstruction to complement this two-level disentanglement so that informative object representations could be preserved. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark datasets and the results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on domain generalization for object detection.

-    Marine debris is severely threatening the marine lives and causing sustained pollution to the whole ecosystem. To prevent the wastes from getting into the ocean, it is helpful to clean up the floating wastes in inland waters using the autonomous cleaning devices like unmanned surface vehicles. The cleaning efficiency relies on a high-accurate and robust object detection system. However, the small size of the target, the strong light reflection over water surface, and the reflection of other objects on bank-side all bring challenges to the vision-based object detection system. To promote the practical application for autonomous floating wastes cleaning, we present FloW, the first dataset for floating waste detection in inland water areas. The dataset consists of an image sub-dataset FloW-Img and a multimodal sub-dataset FloW-RI which contains synchronized millimeter-wave radar data and images. Accurate annotations for images and radar data are provided, supporting floating waste detection strategies based on images, radar data, and the fusion of two sensors. We perform several baseline experiments on our dataset, including vision-based and radar-based detection methods. The results show that, the detection accuracy is relatively low and floating waste detection still remains a challenging task.

-    The generalization capability of deep neural networks has been substantially improved by applying a wide spectrum of regularization methods, e.g., restricting function space, injecting randomness during training, augmenting data, etc. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective regularization method named progressive self-knowledge distillation (PS-KD), which progressively distills a model's own knowledge to soften hard targets (i.e., one-hot vectors) during training. Hence, it can be interpreted within a framework of knowledge distillation as a student becomes a teacher itself. Specifically, targets are adjusted adaptively by combining the ground-truth and past predictions from the model itself. We show that PS-KD provides an effect of hard example mining by rescaling gradients according to difficulty in classifying examples. The proposed method is applicable to any supervised learning tasks with hard targets and can be easily combined with existing regularization methods to further enhance the generalization performance. Furthermore, it is confirmed that PS-KD achieves not only better accuracy, but also provides high quality of confidence estimates in terms of calibration as well as ordinal ranking. Extensive experimental results on three different tasks, image classification, object detection, and machine translation, demonstrate that our method consistently improves the performance of the state-of-the-art baselines.

##### Universal-Prototype Enhancing for Few-Shot Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wu_Universal-Prototype_Enhancing_for_Few-Shot_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to strengthen the performance of novel object detection with few labeled samples. To alleviate the constraint of few samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel objects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should focus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization. Unlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that are universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype, namely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a consistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and the original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object characteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection with universal prototypes ( FSOD ^ up ) that owns the merit of feature generalization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO show the effectiveness of  FSOD ^ up . Particularly, for the 1-shot case of VOC Split2,  FSOD ^ up  outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.

##### Exploring Cross-Image Pixel Contrast for Semantic Segmentation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Exploring_Cross-Image_Pixel_Contrast_for_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Current semantic segmentation methods focus only on mining "local" context, i.e., dependencies between pixels within individual images, by context-aggregation modules (e.g., dilated convolution, neural attention) or structure-aware optimization criteria (e.g., IoU-like loss). However, they ignore "global" context of the training data, i.e., rich semantic relations between pixels across different images. Inspired by recent advance in unsupervised contrastive representation learning, we propose a pixel-wise contrastive algorithm for semantic segmentation in the fully supervised setting. The core idea is to enforce pixel embeddings belonging to a same semantic class to be more similar than embeddings from different classes. It raises a pixel-wise metric learning paradigm for semantic segmentation, by explicitly exploring the structures of labeled pixels, which were rarely explored before. Our method can be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks without extra overhead during testing. We experimentally show that, with famous segmentation models (i.e., DeepLabV3, HRNet, OCR) and backbones (i.e., ResNet, HRNet), our method brings performance improvements across diverse datasets (i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, COCO-Stuff, CamVid). We expect this work will encourage our community to rethink the current de facto training paradigm in semantic segmentation.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhao_Transformer-Based_Dual_Relation_Graph_for_Multi-Label_Image_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The simultaneous recognition of multiple objects in one image remains a challenging task, spanning multiple events in the recognition field such as various object scales, inconsistent appearances, and confused inter-class relationships. Recent research efforts mainly resort to the statistic label co-occurrences and linguistic word embedding to enhance the unclear semantics. Different from these researches, in this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Dual Relation learning framework, constructing complementary relationships by exploring two aspects of correlation, i.e., structural relation graph and semantic relation graph. The structural relation graph aims to capture long-range correlations from object context, by developing a cross-scale transformer-based architecture. The semantic graph dynamically models the semantic meanings of image objects with explicit semantic-aware constraints. In addition, we also incorporate the learnt structural relationship into the semantic graph, constructing a joint relation graph for robust representations. With the collaborative learning of these two effective relation graphs, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art on two popular multi-label recognition benchmarks, i.e. MS-COCO and VOC 2007 dataset.

##### Faster Multi-Object Segmentation Using Parallel Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jeppesen_Faster_Multi-Object_Segmentation_Using_Parallel_Quadratic_Pseudo-Boolean_Optimization_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We introduce a parallel version of the Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) algorithm for solving binary optimization tasks, such as image segmentation. The original QPBO implementation by Kolmogorov and Rother relies on the Boykov-Kolmogorov (BK) maxflow/mincut algorithm and performs well for many image analysis tasks. However, the serial nature of their QPBO algorithm results in poor utilization of modern hardware. By redesigning the QPBO algorithm to work with parallel maxflow/mincut algorithms, we significantly reduce solve time of large optimization tasks. We compare our parallel QPBO implementation to other state-of-the-art solvers and benchmark them on two large segmentation tasks and a substantial set of small segmentation tasks. The results show that our parallel QPBO algorithm is over 20 times faster than the serial QPBO algorithm on the large tasks and over three times faster for the majority of the small tasks. Although we focus on image segmentation, our algorithm is generic and can be used for any QPBO problem. Our implementation and experimental results are available at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5201620

-    Instance segmentation methods require large datasets with expensive and thus limited instance-level mask labels. Partially supervised instance segmentation aims to improve mask prediction with limited mask labels by utilizing the more abundant weak box labels. In this work, we show that a class agnostic mask head, commonly used in partially supervised instance segmentation, has difficulties learning a general concept of foreground for the weakly annotated classes using box supervision only. To resolve this problem, we introduce an object mask prior (OMP) that provides the mask head with the general concept of foreground implicitly learned by the box classification head under the supervision of all classes. This helps the class agnostic mask head to focus on the primary object in a region of interest (RoI) and improves generalization to the weakly annotated classes. We test our approach on the COCO dataset using different splits of strongly and weakly supervised classes. Our approach significantly improves over the Mask R-CNN baseline and obtains competitive performance with the state-of-the-art, while offering a much simpler architecture.

-    Recent advances in 3D perception have shown impressive progress in understanding geometric structures of 3D shapes and even scenes. Inspired by these advances in geometric understanding, we aim to imbue image-based perception with representations learned under geometric constraints. We introduce an approach to learn view-invariant, geometry-aware representations for network pre-training, based on multi-view RGB-D data, that can then be effectively transferred to downstream 2D tasks. We propose to employ contrastive learning under both multi-view image constraints and image-geometry constraints to encode 3D priors into learned 2D representations. This results not only in improvement over 2D-only representation learning on the image-based tasks of semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection on real-world indoor datasets, but moreover, provides significant improvement in the low data regime. We show a significant improvement of 6.0% on semantic segmentation on full data as well as 11.9% on 20% data against our baselines on ScanNet.

##### Federated Learning for Non-IID Data via Unified Feature Learning and Optimization Objective Alignment

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhang_Federated_Learning_for_Non-IID_Data_via_Unified_Feature_Learning_and_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Federated Learning (FL) aims to establish a shared model across decentralized clients under the privacy-preserving constraint. Despite certain success, it is still challenging for FL to deal with non-IID (non-independent and identical distribution) client data, which is a general scenario in real-world FL tasks. It has been demonstrated that the performance of FL will be reduced greatly under the non-IID scenario, since the discrepant data distributions will induce optimization inconsistency and feature divergence issues. Besides, naively minimizing an aggregate loss function in this scenario may have negative impacts on some clients and thus deteriorate their personal model performance. To address these issues, we propose a Unified Feature learning and Optimization objectives alignment method (FedUFO) for non-IID FL. In particular, an adversary module is proposed to reduce the divergence on feature representation among different clients, and two consensus losses are proposed to reduce the inconsistency on optimization objectives from two perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FedUFO can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, including the competitive one data-sharing method. Besides, FedUFO can enable more reasonable and balanced model performance among different clients.

-    Animals have evolved highly functional visual systems to understand motion, assisting perception even under complex environments. In this paper, we work towards developing a computer vision system able to segment objects by exploiting motion cues, i.e. motion segmentation. To achieve this, we introduce a simple variant of the Transformer to segment optical flow frames into primary objects and the background, which can be trained in a self-supervised manner, i.e. without using any manual annotations. Despite using only optical flow, and no appearance information, as input, our approach achieves superior results compared to previous state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on public benchmarks (DAVIS2016, SegTrackv2, FBMS59), while being an order of magnitude faster. On a challenging camouflage dataset (MoCA), we significantly outperform other self-supervised approaches, and are competitive with the top supervised approach, highlighting the importance of motion cues and the potential bias towards appearance in existing video segmentation models.

-    Cross-resolution image alignment is a key problem in multiscale gigapixel photography, which requires to estimate homography matrix using images with large resolution gap. Existing deep homography methods concatenate the input images or features, neglecting the explicit formulation of correspondences between them, which leads to degraded accuracy in cross-resolution challenges. In this paper, we consider the cross-resolution homography estimation as a multimodal problem, and propose a local transformer network embedded within a multiscale structure to explicitly learn correspondences between the multimodal inputs, namely, input images with different resolutions. The proposed local transformer adopts a local attention map specifically for each position in the feature. By combining the local transformer with the multiscale structure, the network is able to capture long-short range correspondences efficiently and accurately. Experiments on both the MS-COCO dataset and real-captured cross-resolution dataset show that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art feature-based and deep-learning-based homography estimation methods, and is able to accurately align images under 10x resolution gap.

-    Different from traditional video cameras, event cameras capture asynchronous events stream in which each event encodes pixel location, trigger time, and the polarity of the brightness changes. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based framework for event cameras, namely SlideGCN. Unlike some recent graph-based methods that use groups of events as input, our approach can efficiently process data event-by-event, unlock the low latency nature of events data while still maintaining the graph's structure internally. For fast graph construction, we develop a radius search algorithm, which better exploits the partial regular structure of event cloud against k-d tree based generic methods. Experiments show that our method reduces the computational complexity up to 100 times with respect to current graph-based methods while keeping state-of-the-art performance on object recognition. Moreover, we verify the superiority of event-wise processing with our method. When the state becomes stable, we can give a prediction with high confidence, thus making an early recognition.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_Leveraging_Auxiliary_Tasks_With_Affinity_Learning_for_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Semantic segmentation is a challenging task in the absence of densely labelled data. Only relying on class activation maps (CAM) with image-level labels provides deficient segmentation supervision. Prior works thus consider pre-trained models to produce coarse saliency maps to guide the generation of pseudo segmentation labels. However, the commonly used off-line heuristic generation process cannot fully exploit the benefits of these coarse saliency maps. Motivated by the significant inter-task correlation, we propose a novel weakly supervised multi-task framework termed as AuxSegNet, to leverage saliency detection and multi-label image classification as auxiliary tasks to improve the primary task of semantic segmentation using only image-level ground-truth labels. Inspired by their similar structured semantics, we also propose to learn a cross-task global pixel-level affinity map from the saliency and segmentation representations. The learned cross-task affinity can be used to refine saliency predictions and propagate CAM maps to provide improved pseudo labels for both tasks. The mutual boost between pseudo label updating and cross-task affinity learning enables iterative improvements on segmentation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary learning network structure and the cross-task affinity learning method. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation performance on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Sheng_Improving_3D_Object_Detection_With_Channel-Wise_Transformer_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Though 3D object detection from point clouds has achieved rapid progress in recent years, the lack of flexible and high-performance proposal refinement remains a great hurdle for existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors. Previous works on refining 3D proposals have relied on human-designed components such as keypoints sampling, set abstraction and multi-scale feature fusion to produce powerful 3D object representations. Such methods, however, have limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In this paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a Channel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object detection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D simultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context aggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D uses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention propagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings. Next, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via channel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which contributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent scalability. Remarkably, CT3D achieves the AP of 81.77% in the moderate car category on the KITTI test 3D detection benchmark, outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Lu_Geometry_Uncertainty_Projection_Network_for_Monocular_3D_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Monocular 3D object detection has received increasing attention due to the wide application in autonomous driving. Existing works mainly focus on introducing geometry projection to predict depth priors for each object. Despite their impressive progress, these methods neglect the geometry leverage effect of the projection process, which leads to uncontrollable inferences and damage the training efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network (GUP Net) to handle these problems, which can guide the model to learn more reliable depth outputs. The overall framework combines the uncertainty inference and the hierarchical task learning to reduce the negative effects of the geometry leverage. Specifically, an Uncertainty Geometry Projection module is proposed to obtain the geometry guided uncertainty of the inferred depth, which can not only benefit the geometry learning but also provide more reliable depth inferences to reduce the uncontrollableness caused by the geometry leverage. Besides, to reduce the instability in the training process caused by the geometry leverage effect, we propose a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy to control the overall optimization process. This learning algorithm can monitor the situation of each task through a well designed learning situation indicator and adaptively assign the proper loss weights for different tasks according to their learning situation and the hierarchical structure, which can significantly improve the stability and the efficiency of the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.The overall model can infer more reliable depth and location information than existing methods, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.

-    Computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic/instance segmentation rely on the painstaking annotation of large training datasets. In this paper, we propose LocTex that takes advantage of the low-cost localized textual annotations (i.e., captions and synchronized mouse-over gestures) to reduce the annotation effort. We introduce a contrastive pre-training framework between images and captions and propose to supervise the cross-modal attention map with rendered mouse traces to provide coarse localization signals. Our learned visual features capture rich semantics (from free-form captions) and accurate localization (from mouse traces), which are very effective when transferred to various downstream vision tasks. Compared with ImageNet supervised pre-training, LocTex can reduce the size of the pre-training dataset by 10x or the target dataset by 2x while achieving comparable or even improved performance on COCO instance segmentation. When provided with the same amount of annotations, LocTex achieves around 4% higher accuracy than the previous state-of-the-art "vision+language" pre-training approach on the task of PASCAL VOC image classification.

-    Existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation, which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to minimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO.

-    We introduce DiscoBox, a novel framework that jointly learns instance segmentation and semantic correspondence using bounding box supervision. Specifically, we propose a self-ensembling framework where instance segmentation and semantic correspondence are jointly guided by a structured teacher in addition to the bounding box supervision. The teacher is a structured energy model incorporating a pairwise potential and a cross-image potential to model the pairwise pixel relationships both within and across the boxes. Minimizing the teacher energy simultaneously yields refined object masks and dense correspondences between intra-class objects, which are taken as pseudo-labels to supervise the task network and provide positive/negative correspondence pairs for dense contrastive learning. We show a symbiotic relationship where the two tasks mutually benefit from each other. Our best model achieves 37.9% AP on COCO instance segmentation, surpassing prior weakly supervised methods and is competitive to supervised methods. We also obtain state of the art weakly supervised results on PASCAL VOC12 and PF-PASCAL with real-time inference.

-    Hough voting, as has been demonstrated in VoteNet, is effective for 3D object detection, where voting is a key step. In this paper, we propose a novel VoteNet-based 3D detector with vote enhancement to improve the detection accuracy in cluttered indoor scenes. It addresses the limitations of current voting schemes, i.e., votes from neighboring objects and background have significant negative impacts Specifically, before voting, we replace the classic MLP with the proposed Attentive MLP (AMLP) in the backbone network to get better feature description of seed points. During voting, we design a new vote attraction loss (VALoss) to enforce vote centers to locate closely and compactly to the corresponding object centers. After voting, we then devise a vote weighting module to integrate the foreground/background prediction into the vote aggregation process to enhance the capability of the original VoteNet to handle noise from background voting. The three proposed strategies all contribute to more effective voting and improved performance, resulting in a novel 3D object detector, termed VENet. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components.

##### Aggregation With Feature Detection
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Sun_Aggregation_With_Feature_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Aggregating features from different depths of a network is widely adopted to improve the network capability.  Lots of modern architectures are equipped with skip connections, which actually makes the feature aggregation happen in all these networks. Since different features tell different semantic meanings, there are inconsistencies and incompatibilities to be solved. However, existing works naively blend deep features via element-wise summation or concatenation with a convolution behind. Better feature aggregation method beyond summation or concatenation is rarely explored. In this paper, given two layers of features to be aggregated together, we first detect and identify where and what needs to be updated in one layer, then replace the feature at the identified location with the information of the other layer. This process, which we call DEtect-rePLAce (DEPLA), enables us to avoid inconsistent patterns while keeping useful information in the merged outputs. Experimental results demonstrate our method largely boosts multiple baselines e.g. ResNet, FishNet and FPN on three major vision tasks including ImageNet classification, MS COCO object detection and instance segmentation.

-    LiDAR sensors can be used to obtain a wide range of measurement signals other than a simple 3D point cloud, and those signals can be leveraged to improve perception tasks like 3D object detection. A single laser pulse can be partially reflected by multiple objects along its path, resulting in multiple measurements called echoes. Multi-echo measurement can provide information about object contours and semi-transparent surfaces which can be used to better identify and locate objects. LiDAR can also measure surface reflectance (intensity of laser pulse return), as well as ambient light of the scene (sunlight reflected by objects). These signals are already available in commercial LiDAR devices but have not been used in most LiDAR-based detection models. We present a 3D object detection model which leverages the full spectrum of measurement signals provided by LiDAR. First, we propose a multi-signal fusion (MSF) module to combine (1) the reflectance and ambient features extracted with a 2D CNN, and (2) point cloud features extracted using a 3D graph neural network (GNN). Second, we propose a multi-echo aggregation (MEA) module to combine the information encoded in different set of echo points. Compared with traditional single echo point cloud methods, our proposed multi-signal LiDAR Detector (MSLiD) extracts richer context information from a wider range of sensing measurements and achieves more accurate 3D object detection. Experiments show that by incorporating the multi-modality of LiDAR, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to relatively 9.1%.

-    ObjectGoal Navigation (ObjectNav) is an embodied task wherein agents are to navigate to an object instance in an unseen environment. Prior works have shown that end-to-end ObjectNav agents that use vanilla visual and recurrent modules, e.g. a CNN+RNN, perform poorly due to overfitting and sample inefficiency. This has motivated current state-of-the-art methods to mix analytic and learned components and operate on explicit spatial maps of the environment. We instead re-enable a generic learned agent by adding auxiliary learning tasks and an exploration reward. Our agents achieve 24.5% success and 8.1% SPL, a 37% and 8% relative improvement over prior state-of-the-art, respectively, on the Habitat ObjectNav Challenge. From our analysis, we propose that agents will act to simplify their visual inputs so as to smooth their RNN dynamics, and that auxiliary tasks reduce overfitting by minimizing effective RNN dimensionality; i.e. a performant ObjectNav agent that must maintain coherent plans over long horizons does so by learning smooth, low-dimensional recurrent dynamics.

-    Recently, DETR pioneered the solution of vision tasks with transformers, it directly translates the image feature map into the object detection result. Though effective, translating the full feature map can be costly due to redundant computation on some area like the background. In this work, we encapsulate the idea of reducing spatial redundancy into a novel poll and pool (PnP) sampling module, with which we build an end-to-end PnP-DETR architecture that adaptively allocates its computation spatially to be more efficient. Concretely, the PnP module abstracts the image feature map into fine foreground object feature vectors and a small number of coarse background contextual feature vectors. The transformer models information interaction within the fine-coarse feature space and translates the features into the detection result. Moreover, the PnP-augmented model can instantly achieve various desired trade-offs between performance and computation with a single model by varying the sampled feature length, without requiring to train multiple models as existing methods. Thus it offers greater flexibility for deployment in diverse scenarios with varying computation constraint. We further validate the generalizability of the PnP module on panoptic segmentation and the recent transformer-based image recognition model ViT and show consistent efficiency gain. We believe our method makes a step for efficient visual analysis with transformers, wherein spatial redundancy is commonly observed. Code and models will be available.

-    People often use physical intuition when manipulating articulated objects, irrespective of object semantics. Motivated by this observation, we identify an important embodied task where an agent must play with objects to recover their parts. To this end, we introduce Act the Part (AtP) to learn how to interact with articulated objects to discover and segment their pieces. By coupling action selection and motion segmentation, AtP is able to isolate structures to make perceptual part recovery possible without semantic labels. Our experiments show AtP learns efficient strategies for part discovery, can generalize to unseen categories, and is capable of conditional reasoning for the task. Although trained in simulation, we show convincing transfer to real world data with no fine-tuning. A summery video, interactive demo, and code will be available at atp.cs.columbia.edu.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jin_Mining_Contextual_Information_Beyond_Image_for_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    This paper studies the context aggregation problem in semantic image segmentation. The existing researches focus on improving the pixel representations by aggregating the contextual information within individual images. Though impressive, these methods neglect the significance of the representations of the pixels of the corresponding class beyond the input image. To address this, this paper proposes to mine the contextual information beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training, to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN, PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements. Mining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff.

-    With the thriving of deep learning, CNN-based object detectors have made great progress in the past decade. However, the domain gap between training and testing data leads to a prominent performance degradation and thus hinders their application in the real world. To alleviate this problem, Knowledge Transfer Network (KTNet) is proposed as a new paradigm for domain adaption. Specifically, KTNet is constructed on a base detector with intrinsic knowledge mining and relational knowledge constraints. First, we design a foreground/background classifier shared by source domain and target domain to extract the common attribute knowledge of objects in different scenarios. Second, we model the relational knowledge graph and explicitly constrain the consistency of category correlation under source domain, target domain, as well as cross-domain conditions. As a result, the detector is guided to learn object-related and domain-independent representation. Extensive experiments and visualizations confirm that transferring object-specific knowledge can yield notable performance gains. The proposed KTNet achieves state-of-the-art results on three cross-domain detection benchmarks.

-    This paper proposes GraviCap, i.e., a new approach for joint markerless 3D human motion capture and object trajectory estimation from monocular RGB videos. We focus on scenes with objects partially observed during a free flight. In contrast to existing monocular methods, we can recover scale, object trajectories as well as human bone lengths in meters and the ground plane's orientation, thanks to the awareness of the gravity constraining object motions. Our objective function is parametrised by the object's initial velocity and position, gravity direction and focal length, and jointly optimised for one or several free flight episodes. The proposed human-object interaction constraints ensure geometric consistency of the 3D reconstructions and improved physical plausibility of human poses compared to the unconstrained case. We evaluate GraviCap on a new dataset with ground-truth annotations for persons and different objects undergoing free flights. In the experiments, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D human motion capture on various metrics. We urge the reader to watch our supplementary video. Both the source code and the dataset are released; see http://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/GraviCap/.

-    Recovering dense human poses from images plays a critical role in establishing an image-to-surface correspondence between RGB images and the 3D surface of the human body, serving the foundation of rich real-world applications, such as virtual humans, monocular-to-3d reconstruction. However, the popular DensePose-COCO dataset relies on a sophisticated manual annotation system, leading to severe limitations in acquiring the denser and more accurate annotated pose resources. In this work, we introduce a new 3D human-body model with a series of decoupled parameters that could freely control the generation of the body. Furthermore, we build a data generation system based on this decoupling 3D model, and construct an ultra dense synthetic benchmark UltraPose, containing around 1.3 billion corresponding points. Compared to the existing manually annotated DensePose-COCO dataset, the synthetic UltraPose has ultra dense image-to-surface correspondences without annotation cost and error. Our proposed UltraPose provides the largest benchmark and data resources for lifting the model capability in predicting more accurate dense poses. To promote future researches in this field, we also propose a transformer-based method to model the dense correspondence between 2D and 3D worlds. The proposed model trained on synthetic UltraPose can be applied to real-world scenarios, indicating the effectiveness of our benchmark and model.

##### MFNet: Multi-Filter Directive Network for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection

-    Weakly supervised salient object detection (WSOD) targets to train a CNNs-based saliency network using only low-cost annotations. Existing WSOD methods take various techniques to pursue single "high-quality" pseudo label from low-cost annotations and then develop their saliency networks. Though these methods have achieved good performance, the generated single label is inevitably affected by adopted refinement algorithms and shows prejudiced characteristics which further influence the saliency networks. In this work, we introduce a new multiple-pseudo label framework to integrate more comprehensive and accurate saliency cues from multiple labels, avoiding the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we propose a multi-filer directive network (MFNet) including a saliency network as well as multiple directive filters. The directive filter (DF) is designed to extract and filter more accurate saliency cues from the noisy pseudo labels. The multiple accurate cues from multiple DFs are then simultaneously propagated to the saliency network with a multi-guidance loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets over four metrics demonstrate that our method outperforms all the existing congeneric methods. Moreover, it is also worth noting that our framework is flexible enough to apply to existing methods and improve their performance.

-    In recent years, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have been experiencing growth in various applications. With the expansion of USVs' application scenes from the typical marine areas to inland waters, new challenges arise for the object detection task, which is an essential part of the perception system of USVs. In our work, we focus on a relatively unexplored task for USVs in inland waters: small object detection on water surfaces, which is of vital importance for safe autonomous navigation and USVs' certain missions such as floating waste cleaning. Considering the limitations of vision-based object detection, we propose a novel vision-radar fusion based method for robust small object detection on water surfaces. By using a novel representation format of millimeter wave radar point clouds and applying a deep-level multi-scale fusion of RGB images and radar data, the proposed method can efficiently utilize the characteristics of radar data and improve the accuracy and robustness for small object detection on water surfaces. We test the method on the real-world floating bottle dataset that we collected and released. The result shows that, our method improves the average detection accuracy significantly compared to the vision-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the proposed method performs robustly when single sensor degrades.

##### Conditional DETR for Fast Training Convergence

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Meng_Conditional_DETR_for_Fast_Training_Convergence_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box, which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query, each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101. Code is available at https://github.com/Atten4Vis/ConditionalDETR.

-    In prevalent knowledge distillation, logits in most image recognition models are computed by global average pooling, then used to learn to encode the high-level and task-relevant knowledge. In this work, we solve the limitation of this global logit transfer in this distillation context. We point out that it prevents the transfer of informative spatial information, which provides localized knowledge as well as rich relational information across contexts of an input scene. To exploit the rich spatial information, we propose a simple yet effective logit distillation approach. We add a local spatial pooling layer branch to the penultimate layer, thereby our method extends the standard logit distillation and enables learning of both finely-localized knowledge and holistic representation. Our proposed method shows favorable accuracy improvement against the state-of-the-art methods on several image classification datasets. We show that our distilled students trained on the image classification task can be successfully leveraged for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks; this result demonstrates our method's high transferability.

-    Localizing objects and estimating their extent in 3D is an important step towards high-level 3D scene understanding, which has many applications in Augmented Reality and Robotics. We present ODAM, a system for 3D Object Detection, Association, and Mapping using posed RGB videos. The proposed system relies on a deep-learning-based front-end to detect 3D objects from a given RGB frame and associate them to a global object-based map using a graph neural network (GNN). Based on these frame-to-model associations, our back-end optimizes object bounding volumes, represented as super-quadrics, under multi-view geometry constraints and the object scale prior. We validate the proposed system on ScanNet where we show a significant improvement over existing RGB-only methods.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhou_Learning_Specialized_Activation_Functions_With_the_Piecewise_Linear_Unit_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The choice of activation functions is crucial for modern deep neural networks. Popular hand-designed activation functions like Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU) and its variants show promising performance in various tasks and models. Swish, the automatically discovered activation function, outperforms ReLU on many challenging datasets. However, it has two main drawbacks. First, the tree-based search space is highly discrete and restricted, making it difficult to searching. Second, the sample-based searching method is inefficient, making it infeasible to find specialized activation functions for each dataset or neural architecture. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a new activation function called Piecewise Linear Unit(PWLU), which incorporates a carefully designed formulation and learning method. It can learn specialized activation functions and achieves SOTA performance on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and COCO. For example, on ImageNet classification dataset, PWLU improves 0.9%/0.53%/1.0%/1.7%/1.0% top-1 accuracy over Swish for ResNet-18/ResNet-50/MobileNet-V2/MobileNet-V3/EfficientNet-B0. PWLU is also easy to implement and efficient at inference, which can be widely applied in real-world applications.

-    Category-level 6D object pose and size estimation is to predict full pose configurations of rotation, translation, and size for object instances observed in single, arbitrary views of cluttered scenes. In this paper, we propose a new method of Dual Pose Network with refined learning of pose consistency for this task, shortened as DualPoseNet. DualPoseNet stacks two parallel pose decoders on top of a shared pose encoder, where the implicit decoder predicts object poses with a working mechanism different from that of the explicit one; they thus impose complementary supervision on the training of pose encoder. We construct the encoder based on spherical convolutions, and design a module of Spherical Fusion wherein for a better embedding of pose-sensitive features from the appearance and shape observations. Given no testing CAD models, it is the novel introduction of the implicit decoder that enables the refined pose prediction during testing, by enforcing the predicted pose consistency between the two decoders using a self-adaptive loss term. Thorough experiments on benchmarks of both category- and instance-level object pose datasets confirm efficacy of our designs. DualPoseNet outperforms existing methods with a large margin in the regime of high precision. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/DualPoseNet.

-    Instance segmentation models today are very accurate when trained on large annotated datasets, but collecting mask annotations at scale is prohibitively expensive. We address the partially supervised instance segmentation problem in which one can train on (significantly cheaper) bounding boxes for all categories but use masks only for a subset of categories. In this work, we focus on a popular family of models which apply differentiable cropping to a feature map and predict a mask based on the resulting crop. Under this family, we study Mask R-CNN and discover that instead of its default strategy of training the mask-head with a combination of proposals and groundtruth boxes, training the mask-head with only groundtruth boxes dramatically improves its performance on novel classes. This training strategy also allows us to take advantage of alternative mask-head architectures, which we exploit by replacing the typical mask-head of 2-4 layers with significantly deeper off-the-shelf architectures (e.g. ResNet, Hourglass models). While many of these architectures perform similarly when trained in fully supervised mode, our main finding is that they can generalize to novel classes in dramatically different ways. We call this ability of mask-heads to generalize to unseen classes the strong mask generalization effect and show that without any specialty modules or losses, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in the partially supervised COCO instance segmentation benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate that our effect is general, holding across underlying detection methodologies (including anchor-based, anchor-free or no detector at all) and across different backbone networks. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://git.io/deepmac.

##### MLVSNet: Multi-Level Voting Siamese Network for 3D Visual Tracking

-    Benefiting from the excellent performance of Siamese-based trackers, huge progress on 2D visual tracking has been achieved. However, 3D visual tracking is still under-explored. Inspired by the idea of Hough voting in 3D object detection, in this paper, we propose a Multi-level Voting Siamese Network (MLVSNet) for 3D visual tracking from outdoor point cloud sequences. To deal with sparsity in outdoor 3D point clouds, we propose to perform Hough voting on multi-level features to get more vote centers and retain more useful information, instead of voting only on the final level feature as in previous methods. We also design an efficient and lightweight Target-Guided Attention (TGA) module to transfer the target information and highlight the target points in the search area. Moreover, we propose a Vote-cluster Feature Enhancement (VFE) module to exploit the relationships between different vote clusters. Extensive experiments on the 3D tracking benchmark of KITTI dataset demonstrate that our MLVSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant margins. Code will be available at https://github.com/CodeWZT/MLVSNet.

-    Current 3D single object tracking approaches track the target based on a feature comparison between the target template and the search area. However, due to the common occlusion in LiDAR scans, it is non-trivial to conduct accurate feature comparisons on severe sparse and incomplete shapes. In this work, we exploit the ground truth bounding box given in the first frame as a strong cue to enhance the feature description of the target object, enabling a more accurate feature comparison in a simple yet effective way. In particular, we first propose the BoxCloud, an informative and robust representation, to depict an object using the point-to-box relation. We further design an efficient box-aware feature fusion module, which leverages the aforementioned BoxCloud for reliable feature matching and embedding. Integrating the proposed general components into an existing model P2B, we construct a superior box-aware tracker (BAT). Experiments confirm that our proposed BAT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin on both KITTI and NuScenes benchmarks, achieving a 12.8% improvement in terms of precision while running  20% faster.

-    Dark environment becomes a challenge for computer vision algorithms owing to insufficient photons and undesirable noises. Most of the existing studies tackle this by either targeting human vision for better visual perception or improving the machine vision for specific high-level tasks. In addition, these methods rely on data argumentation and directly train their models based on real-world or over-simplified synthetic datasets without exploring the intrinsic pattern behind illumination translation. Here, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model that combines human vision and machine vision tasks to enhance object detection in a dark environment. With a self-supervision learning, the MAET learns an intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading transformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP). Based on this representation, we achieve object detection task by decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using the normal target detection datasets, such as COCO and VOC. We have achieved the state-of-the-art performance using synthetic and real-world datasets.

-    Object recognition has made great advances in the last decade, but predominately still relies on many high-quality training examples per object category. In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in the real-world application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low-vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones. The benchmark reflects a realistic, highly challenging recognition problem, providing a rich playground to drive research in robustness to few-shot, high-variation conditions. We set the benchmark's first state-of-the-art and show there is massive scope for further innovation, holding the potential to impact a broad range of real-world vision applications including tools for the blind/low-vision community.

-    In order to robustly deploy object detectors across a wide range of scenarios, they should be adaptable to shifts in the input distribution without the need to constantly annotate new data. This has motivated research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms for detection. UDA methods learn to adapt from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, by inducing alignment between detector features from source and target domains. Yet, there is no consensus on what features to align and how to do the alignment. In our work, we propose a framework that generalizes the different components commonly used by UDA methods laying the ground for an in-depth analysis of the UDA design space. Specifically, we propose a novel UDA algorithm, ViSGA, a direct implementation of our framework, that leverages the best design choices and introduces a simple but effective method to aggregate features at the instance-level based on the visual similarity before inducing group alignment via adversarial training. We show that both similarity-based grouping and adversarial training allows our model to focus on coarsely aligning feature groups, without being forced to match all instances across loosely aligned domains. Finally, we examine the applicability of ViSGA to the setting where labeled data are gathered from different sources. Experiments show that not only our method outperforms previous single-source approaches on Sim2Real and Adverse Weather, but also generalizes well to the multi-source setting.

-    We consider the problem of online and real-time registration of partial point clouds obtained from an unseen real-world rigid object without knowing its 3D model. The point cloud is partial as it is obtained by a depth sensor capturing only the visible part of the object from a certain viewpoint. It introduces two main challenges: 1) two partial point clouds do not fully overlap and 2) keypoints tend to be less reliable when the visible part of the object does not have salient local structures. To address these issues, we propose DeepPRO, a keypoint-free and an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. Its core idea is inspired by how humans align two point clouds: we can imagine how two point clouds will look like after the registration based on their shape. To realize the idea, DeepPRO has inputs of two partial point clouds and directly predicts the point-wise location of the aligned point cloud. By preserving the ordering of points during the prediction, we enjoy dense correspondences between input and predicted point clouds when inferring rigid transform parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Linemod and synthetic ModelNet40 datasets. In addition, we collect and evaluate on the PRO1k dataset, a large-scale version of Linemod meant to test generalization to real-world scans. Results show that DeepPRO achieves the best accuracy against thirteen strong baseline methods, e.g., 2.2mm ADD on the Linemod dataset, while running 50 fps on mobile devices.

-    We present Voxel Transformer (VoTr), a novel and effective voxel-based Transformer backbone for 3D object detection from point clouds. Conventional 3D convolutional backbones in voxel-based 3D detectors cannot efficiently capture large context information, which is crucial for object recognition and localization, owing to the limited receptive fields. In this paper, we resolve the problem by introducing a Transformer-based architecture that enables long-range relationships between voxels by self-attention. Given the fact that non-empty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous, directly applying standard Transformer on voxels is non-trivial. To this end, we propose the sparse voxel module and the submanifold voxel module, which can operate on the empty and non-empty voxel positions effectively. To further enlarge the attention range while maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional counterparts, we propose two attention mechanisms for multi-head attention in those two modules: Local Attention and Dilated Attention, and we further propose Fast Voxel Query to accelerate the querying process in multi-head attention. VoTr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules and can be applied in most voxel-based detectors. Our proposed VoTr shows consistent improvement over the convolutional baselines while maintaining computational efficiency on the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset.

-    Effectively structuring deep knowledge plays a pivotal role in transfer from teacher to student, especially in semantic vision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple knowledge structure to exploit and encode information inside the detection system to facilitate detector knowledge distillation. Specifically, aiming at solving the feature imbalance problem while further excavating the missing relation inside semantic instances, we design a graph whose nodes correspond to instance proposal-level features and edges represent the relation between nodes. To further refine this graph, we design an adaptive background loss weight to reduce node noise and background samples mining to prune trivial edges. We transfer the entire graph as encoded knowledge representation from teacher to student, capturing local and global information simultaneously. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging COCO object detection task with diverse student-teacher pairs on both one- and two-stage detectors. We also experiment with instance segmentation to demonstrate robustness of our method. It is notable that distilled Faster R-CNN with ResNet18-FPN and ResNet50-FPN yields 38.68 and 41.82 Box AP respectively on the COCO benchmark, Faster R-CNN with ResNet101-FPN significantly achieves 43.38 AP, which outperforms ResNet152-FPN teacher about 0.7 AP.

-    In this paper, we propose to learn an Unsupervised Single Object Tracker (USOT) from scratch. We identify that three major challenges, i.e., moving object discovery, rich temporal variation exploitation, and online update, are the central causes of the performance bottleneck of existing unsupervised trackers. To narrow the gap between unsupervised trackers and supervised counterparts, we propose an effective unsupervised learning approach composed of three stages. First, we sample sequentially moving objects with unsupervised optical flow and dynamic programming, instead of random cropping. Second, we train a naive Siamese tracker from scratch using single-frame pairs. Third, we continue training the tracker with a novel cycle memory learning scheme, which is conducted in longer temporal spans and also enables our tracker to update online. Extensive experiments show that the proposed USOT learned from unlabeled videos performs well over the state-of-the-art unsupervised trackers by large margins, and on par with recent supervised deep trackers.

Though visual perception plays an important role in the object handover task, the whole handover process has been specifically explored. In this work, we propose a novel rich-annotated dataset, H2O, for visual analysis of human-human object handovers. The H2O, which contains 18K video clips involving 15 people who hand over 30 objects to each other, is a multi-purpose benchmark. It can support several vision-based tasks, from which, we specifically provide a baseline method, RGPNet, for a less-explored task named Receiver Grasp Prediction. Extensive experiments show that the RGPNet can produce plausible grasps based on the giver's hand-object states in the pre-handover phase. Besides, we also report the hand and object pose errors with existing baselines and show that the dataset can serve as the video demonstrations for robot imitation learning on the handover task.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhang_Hierarchical_Object-to-Zone_Graph_for_Object_Navigation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The goal of object navigation is to reach the expected objects according to visual information in the unseen environments. Previous works usually implement deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction. Our methods are evaluated on the AI2-Thor simulator. In addition to widely used evaluation metrics SR and SPL, we also propose a new evaluation metric of SAE that focuses on the effective action rate. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/sx-zhang/HOZ.git.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhu_Transfusion_A_Novel_SLAM_Method_Focused_on_Transparent_Objects_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Recently RGB-D sensors have become very popular in the area of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The RGB-D SLAM approach relies heavily on the accuracy of the input depth map. However, refraction and reflection of transparent objects will result in false depth input of RGB-D cameras, which makes the traditional RGB-D SLAM algorithm unable to work correctly in the presence of transparent objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM approach called transfusion that allows transparent object existence and recovery in the video input. Our method is composed of two parts. Transparent Objects Cut Iterative Closest Points (TC-ICP)is first used to recover camera pose, detecting and removing transparent objects from input to reduce the trajectory errors. Then Transparent Objects Reconstruction (TO-Reconstruction) is used to reconstruct the transparent objects and opaque objects separately. The opaque objects are reconstructed with the traditional method, and the transparent objects are reconstructed with the visual hull-based method. To evaluate our algorithm, we construct a new RGB-D SLAM database containing 25 video sequences. Each sequence has at least one transparent object. Experiments show that our approach can work adequately in scenes contain transparent objects while the existing approach can not handle them. Our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the camera trajectory and the quality of environment reconstruction.

-    We present Hierarchical Memory Matching Network (HMMN) for semi-supervised video object segmentation. Based on a recent memory-based method [33], we propose two advanced memory read modules that enable us to perform memory reading in multiple scales while exploiting temporal smoothness. We first propose a kernel guided memory matching module that replaces the non-local dense memory read, commonly adopted in previous memory-based methods. The module imposes the temporal smoothness constraint in the memory read, leading to accurate memory retrieval. More importantly, we introduce a hierarchical memory matching scheme and propose a top-k guided memory matching module in which memory read on a fine-scale is guided by that on a coarse-scale. With the module, we perform memory read in multiple scales efficiently and leverage both high-level semantic and low-level fine-grained memory features to predict detailed object masks. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the validation sets of DAVIS 2016/2017 (90.8% and 84.7%) and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 (82.6% and 82.5%), and test-dev set of DAVIS 2017 (78.6%).

-    Most existing trackers based on deep learning perform tracking in a holistic strategy, which aims to learn deep representations of the whole target for localizing the target. It is arduous for such methods to track targets with various appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of methods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into equal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is inferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential limitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for tracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In this paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are discriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency mining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a saliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies together to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar and the search image for state estimation. Extensive experiments on five diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers.

-    Online continual learning from data streams in dynamic environments is a critical direction in the computer vision field. However, realistic benchmarks and fundamental studies in this line are still missing. To bridge the gap, we present a new online continual object detection benchmark with an egocentric video dataset, Objects Around Krishna (OAK). OAK adopts the KrishnaCAM videos, an ego-centric video stream collected over nine months by a graduate student. OAK provides exhaustive bounding box annotations of 80 video snippets (~17.5 hours) for 105 object categories in outdoor scenes. The emergence of new object categories in our benchmark follows a pattern similar to what a single person might see in their day-to-day life. The dataset also captures the natural distribution shifts as the person travels to different places. These egocentric long running videos provide a realistic playground for continual learning algorithms, especially in online embodied settings. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the model performance and catastrophic forgetting and provide baseline studies for online continual object detection. We believe this benchmark will pose new exciting challenges for learning from non-stationary data in continual learning. The OAK dataset and the associated benchmark are released at https://oakdata.github.io/.

##### Anonymizing Egocentric Videos
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Thapar_Anonymizing_Egocentric_Videos_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    In egocentric videos, the face of a wearer capturing the video is never captured. This gives a false sense of security that the wearer's privacy is preserved while sharing such videos. However, egocentric cameras are typically harnessed to wearer's head, and hence, also capture wearer's gait. Recent works have shown that wearer gait signatures can be extracted from egocentric videos, which can be used to determine if two egocentric videos have the same wearer. In a more damaging scenario, one can even recognize a wearer using hand gestures from egocentric videos, or identify a wearer in third person videos such as from a surveillance camera. We believe, this could be a death knell in sharing of egocentric videos, and fatal for egocentric vision research. In this work, we suggest a novel technique to anonymize egocentric videos, which create carefully crafted, but small, and imperceptible optical flow perturbations in an egocentric video's frames. Importantly, these perturbations do not affect object detection or action/activity recognition from egocentric videos but are strong enough to dis-balance the gait recovery process. In our experiments on benchmark \epic dataset, the proposed perturbation degrades the wearer recognition performance of [??], from 66.3% to 13.4%, while preserving the activity recognition performance of [??] from 89.6% to 87.4%. To test our anonymization with more wearer recognition techniques, we also developed a stronger, and more generalizable wearer recognition method based on camera egomotion cues. The approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of 59.67% on \epicns, compared to 55.06% by [??]. However, the accuracy of our recognition technique also drops to 12% using the proposed anonymizing perturbations.

-    State-of-the-art object detection approaches typically rely on pre-trained classification models to achieve better performance and faster convergence. We hypothesize that classification pre-training strives to achieve translation invariance, and consequently ignores the localization aspect of the problem. We propose a new large-scale pre-training strategy for detection, where noisy class labels are available for all images, but not bounding-boxes. In this setting, we augment standard classification pre-training with a new detection-specific pretext task. Motivated by the noise-contrastive learning based self-supervised approaches, we design a task that forces bounding boxes with high-overlap to have similar representations in different views of an image, compared to non-overlapping boxes. We redesign Faster R-CNN modules to perform this task efficiently. Our experimental results show significant improvements over existing weakly-supervised and self-supervised pre-training approaches in both detection accuracy as well as fine-tuning speed.

##### Towards Rotation Invariance in Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kalra_Towards_Rotation_Invariance_in_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Rotation augmentations generally improve a model's invariance/equivariance to rotation - except in object detection. In object detection the shape is not known, therefore rotation creates a label ambiguity. We show that the de-facto method for bounding box label rotation, the Largest Box Method, creates very large labels, leading to poor performance and in many cases worse performance than using no rotation at all. We propose a new method of rotation augmentation that can be implemented in a few lines of code. First, we create a differentiable approximation of label accuracy and show that axis-aligning the bounding box around an ellipse is optimal. We then introduce Rotation Uncertainty (RU) Loss, allowing the model to adapt to the uncertainty of the labels. On five different datasets (including COCO, PascalVOC, and Transparent Object Bin Picking), this approach improves the rotational invariance of both one-stage and two-stage architectures when measured with AP, AP50, and AP75.

##### Unlocking the Potential of Ordinary Classifier: Class-Specific Adversarial Erasing Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation

-    Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level classification labels usually utilizes the Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to localize objects of interest in images. While pointing out that CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of the classes of interest, adversarial erasing (AE) methods have been proposed to further explore the less discriminative regions. In this paper, we review the potential of the pre-trained classifier which is trained on the raw images. We experimentally verify that the ordinary classifier already has the capability to activate the less discriminative regions if the most discriminative regions are erased to some extent. Based on that, we propose a class-specific AE-based framework that fully exploits the potential of an ordinary classifier. Our framework (1) adopts the ordinary classifier to notify the regions to be erased and (2) generates a class-specific mask for erasing by randomly sampling a single specific class to be erased (target class) among the existing classes on the image for obtaining more precise CAMs. Specifically, with the guidance of the ordinary classifier, the proposed CAMs Generation Network (CGNet) is enforced to generate a CAM of the target class while constraining the CAM not to intrude the object regions of the other classes. Along with the pseudo-labels refined from our CAMs, we achieve the state-of-the-art WSSS performance on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO dataset only with image-level supervision.

-    Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a crucial component in digital cameras that transforms sensor signals into images for us to perceive and understand. Existing ISP designs always adopt a fixed architecture, e.g., several sequential modules connected in a rigid order. Such a fixed ISP architecture may be suboptimal for real-world applications, where camera sensors, scenes and tasks are diverse. In this study, we propose a novel Reconfigurable ISP (ReconfigISP) whose architecture and parameters can be automatically tailored to specific data and tasks. In particular, we implement several ISP modules, and enable backpropagation for each module by training a differentiable proxy, hence allowing us to leverage the popular differentiable neural architecture search and effectively search for the optimal ISP architecture. A proxy tuning mechanism is adopted to maintain the accuracy of proxy networks in all cases. Extensive experiments conducted on image restoration and object detection, with different sensors, light conditions and efficiency constraints, validate the effectiveness of ReconfigISP. Only hundreds of parameters need tuning for every task.

-    Vision Transformer (ViT) extends the application range of transformers from language processing to computer vision tasks as being an alternative architecture against the existing convolutional neural networks (CNN). Since the transformer-based architecture has been innovative for computer vision modeling, the design convention towards an effective architecture has been less studied yet. From the successful design principles of CNN, we investigate the role of spatial dimension conversion and its effectiveness on transformer-based architecture. We particularly attend to the dimension reduction principle of CNNs; as the depth increases, a conventional CNN increases channel dimension and decreases spatial dimensions. We empirically show that such a spatial dimension reduction is beneficial to a transformer architecture as well, and propose a novel Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT) upon the original ViT model. We show that PiT achieves the improved model capability and generalization performance against ViT. Throughout the extensive experiments, we further show PiT outperforms the baseline on several tasks such as image classification, object detection, and robustness evaluation.

-    In multi-object detection using neural networks, the fundamental problem is, "How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different input images?". Previous methods train a multi-object detection network through a procedure that directly assigns the ground truth bounding boxes to the specific locations of the network's output. However, this procedure makes the training of a multi-object detection network too heuristic and complicated. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-object detection task as a problem of density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to specific locations of network's output, we train a network by estimating the probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model. For this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection called Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the corresponding objective function for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO dataset. Our proposed method not only deals with multi-object detection problems in a new approach, but also improves detection performances through MDOD.

-    We propose the first learning-based approach for fast moving objects detection. Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and matting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the separation of deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring allows achieving real-time performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes of application. The proposed method detects fast moving objects as a truncated distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the sharp appearance estimation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred appearance without background, followed by an energy minimization based deblurring. The state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Compared to other methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude faster and allows applications such as real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections.

-    In this paper, we propose an anchor-free single-stage LiDAR-based 3D object detector -- RangeDet. The most notable difference with previous works is that our method is purely based on the range view representation. Compared with the commonly used voxelized or Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, the range view representation is more compact and without quantization error. Although there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its performance in object detection is largely behind voxelized or BEV counterparts. We first analyze the existing range-view-based methods and find two issues overlooked by previous works: 1) the scale variation between nearby and far away objects; 2) the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature extraction and the 3D Cartesian coordinates used in output. Then we deliberately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet. We test our RangeDet in the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). Our best model achieves 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist. These results outperform other range-view-based methods by a large margin, and are overall comparable with the state-of-the-art multi-view-based methods.

-    In this work, we devote to address the challenging problem of scene parsing. Previous methods, though capture context to exploit global clues, handle scene parsing as a pixel-independent task. However, it is well known that pixels in an image are highly correlated with each other, especially those from the same semantic region, while treating pixels independently fails to take advantage of such correlations. In this work, we treat each respective region in an image as a whole, and capture the structure topology as well as the affinity among different regions. To this end, we first divide the entire feature maps to different regions and extract respective global features from them. Next, we construct a directed graph whose nodes are regional features, and the edge connecting every two nodes is the affinity between the regional features they represent. After that, we transfer the affinity-aware nodes in the directed graph back to corresponding regions of the image, which helps to model the region dependencies and mitigate unrealistic results. In addition, to further boost the correlation among pixels, we propose a region-level loss that evaluates all pixels in a region as a whole and motivates the network to learn the exclusive regional feature per class. With the proposed approach, we achieves new state-of-the-art segmentation results on PASCAL-Context, ADE20K, and COCO-Stuff consistently.

-    One of the fundamental goals of visual perception is to allow agents to meaningfully interact with their environment. In this paper, we take a step towards that long-term goal -- we extract highly localized actionable information related to elementary actions such as pushing or pulling for articulated objects with movable parts. For example, given a drawer, our network predicts that applying a pulling force on the handle opens the drawer. We propose, discuss, and evaluate novel network architectures that given image and depth data, predict the set of actions possible at each pixel, and the regions over articulated parts that are likely to move under the force. We propose a learning-from-interaction framework with an online data sampling strategy that allows us to train the network in simulation (SAPIEN) and generalizes across categories.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yuan_Differentiable_Dynamic_Wirings_for_Neural_Networks_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    A standard practice of deploying deep neural networks is to apply the same architecture to all the input instances. However, a fixed architecture may not be suitable for different data with high diversity. To boost the model capacity, existing methods usually employ larger convolutional kernels or deeper network layers, which incurs prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns the instance-aware connectivity that creates different wiring patterns for different instances. 1) Specifically, the network is initialized as a complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks and the edges represent the connection paths. 2) We generate edge weights by a learnable module, Router, and select the edges whose weights are larger than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure. 3) Instead of using the same path of the network, DDW aggregates features dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation power. To facilitate effective training, we further represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in the backward pass. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with several mainstream architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet. Extensive experiments are performed on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach.

-    In this work, we tackle the problem of category-level online pose tracking for objects from point cloud sequences. For the first time, we propose a unified framework that can handle 9DoF object pose tracking for novel rigid object instances as well as per-part pose tracking for articulated objects from known categories. Here the 9DoF pose, comprising 6D pose and 3D size, is equivalent to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth point cloud at the current frame and the estimated pose from the last frame, our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our pipeline is composed of three modules: 1) a pose canonicalization module that normalizes the pose of the input depth point cloud; 2) RotationNet, a module that directly regresses small interframe delta rotations; and 3) CoordinateNet, a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline optimized for 9DoF pose accuracy (without using non-differentiable RANSAC). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on category-level rigid object pose and articulated object pose benchmarks at the fastest FPS  12.

-    Self-supervised pretraining has been shown to yield powerful representations for transfer learning. These performance gains come at a large computational cost however, with state-of-the-art methods requiring an order of magnitude more computation than supervised pretraining. We tackle this computational bottleneck by introducing a new self-supervised objective, contrastive detection, which tasks representations with identifying object-level features across augmentations. This objective extracts a rich learning signal per image, leading to state-of-the-art transfer accuracy on a variety of downstream tasks, while requiring up to 10x less pretraining. In particular, our strongest ImageNet-pretrained model performs on par with SEER, one of the largest self-supervised systems to date, which uses 1000x more pretraining data. Finally, our objective seamlessly handles pretraining on more complex images such as those in COCO, closing the gap with supervised transfer learning from COCO to PASCAL.

-    Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental visual task aiming at localizing and recognizing interactions between humans and objects. Existing works focus on the visual and linguistic features of humans and objects. However, they do not captalise on the high-level and semantic relationships present in the image, which provides crucial contextual and detailed relational knowledge for HOI inference. We propose a novel method to exploit this information, through the scene graph, for the HumanObject Interaction (SG2HOI) detection task. Our method, SG2HOI, incorporates the SG information in two ways: (1) we embed a scene graph into a global context clue, serving as the scene-specific environmental context; and (2) we build a relation-aware message-passing module to gather relationships from objects' neighborhood and transfer them into interactions. Empirical evaluation shows that our SG2HOI method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark HOI datasets: V-COCO and HICO-DET.

-    Video objection detection is a challenging task because isolated video frames may encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for detection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named TF-Blender, which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation models the relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of every neighboring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks. For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.

-    In recent years, many dexterous robotic hands have been designed to assist or replace human hands in executing various tasks. But how to teach them to perform dexterous operations like human hands is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a grasp synthesis framework to make robots grasp and manipulate objects like human beings. We first build a dataset by accurately segmenting the functional areas of the object and annotating semantic touch code for each functional area to guide the dexterous hand to complete the functional grasp and post-grasp manipulation. This dataset contains 18 categories of 129 objects selected from four datasets, and 15 people participated in data annotation. Then we carefully design four loss functions to constrain the network, which successfully generates the functional grasp of dexterous hand under the guidance of semantic touch code. The thorough experiments in synthetic data show our model can robustly generate functional grasp, even for objects that the model has not see before.

-    To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster RCNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

-    Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is an important task for novel (unseen) object segmentation under the data-scarcity scenario. However, most FSS methods rely on unidirectional feature aggregation, e.g., from support prototypes to get the query prediction, and from high-resolution features to guide the low-resolution ones. This usually fails to fully capture the cross-resolution feature relationships and thus leads to inaccurate estimates of the query objects. To resolve the above dilemma, we propose a cyclic memory network (CMN) to directly learn to read abundant support information from all resolution features in a cyclic manner. Specifically, we first generate N pairs (key and value) of multi-resolution query features guided by the support feature and its mask. Next, we circularly take one pair of these features as the query to be segmented, and the rest N-1 pairs are written into an external memory accordingly, i.e., this leave-one-out process is conducted for N times. In each cycle, the query feature is updated by collaboratively matching its key and value with the memory, which can elegantly cover all the spatial locations from different resolutions. Furthermore, we incorporate the query feature re-adding and the query feature recursive updating mechanisms into the memory reading operation. CMN, equipped with these merits, can thus capture cross-resolution relationships and better handle the object appearance and scale variations in FSS. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i well validate the effectiveness of our model for FSS.

-    Most recent transformer-based models show impressive performance on vision tasks, even better than Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In this work, we present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed twin transformer is timeand resource-efficient since only a row and a column attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches. We hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline for instance-level recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/easton-cau/SOTR.

-    Most existing human matting algorithms tried to separate pure human-only foreground from the background. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Multi-modality Foreground Matting (VMFM) method to learn human-object interactive foreground (human and objects interacted with him or her) from a raw RGB image. The VMFM method requires no additional inputs, e.g. trimap or known background. We reformulate foreground matting as a self-supervised multi-modality problem: factor each input image into estimated depth map, segmentation mask, and interaction heatmap using three auto-encoders. In order to fully utilize the characteristics of each modality, we first train a dual encoder-to-decoder network to estimate the same alpha matte. Then we introduce a self-supervised method: Complementary Learning(CL) to predict deviation probability map and exchange reliable gradients across modalities without label. We conducted extensive experiments to analyze the effectiveness of each modality and the significance of different components in complementary learning. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

-    The classification and regression head are both indispensable components to build up a dense object detector, which are usually supervised by the same training samples and thus expected to have consistency with each other for detecting objects accurately in final detection pipelines. In this paper, we break the convention of the same training samples for these two heads in dense detectors and explore a novel supervisory paradigm, termed as Mutual Supervision (MuSu), to respectively and mutually assign training samples for the classification and regression head to ensure this consistency. MuSu defines training samples for the regression head mainly based on classification predicting scores and in turn, defines samples for the classification head based on localization scores from the regression head. Experimental results show that the convergence of detectors trained by this mutual supervision is guaranteed and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on the challenging MS COCO benchmark. We also find that tiling more anchors at the same location benefits detectors and leads to further improvements under this training scheme. We hope this work can inspire further researches on the interaction of the classification and regression task in detection and the supervision paradigm for detectors, especially separately for these two heads.

-    Relative position encoding (RPE) is important for transformer to capture sequence ordering of input tokens. General efficacy has been proven in natural language processing. However, in computer vision, its efficacy is not well studied and even remains controversial, e.g., whether relative position encoding can work equally well as absolute position? In order to clarify this, we first review existing relative position encoding methods and analyze their pros and cons when applied in vision transformers. We then propose new relative position encoding methods dedicated to 2D images, called image RPE (iRPE). Our methods consider directional relative distance modeling as well as the interactions between queries and relative position embeddings in self-attention mechanism. The proposed iRPE methods are simple and lightweight. They can be easily plugged into transformer blocks. Experiments demonstrate that solely due to the proposed encoding methods, DeiT and DETR obtain up to 1.5% (top-1 Acc) and 1.3% (mAP) stable improvements over their original versions on ImageNet and COCO respectively, without tuning any extra hyperparameters such as learning rate and weight decay. Our ablation and analysis also yield interesting findings, some of which run counter to previous understanding.

-    Aiming at discovering and locating most distinctive objects from visual scenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various computer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are facing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they try to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects boundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This practice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems, resulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task into a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a high-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task, LRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify the definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a regression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels in the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution with limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty into the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution refinement task without using any high-resolution training data. Extensive experiments on high-resolution saliency datasets as well as some widely used saliency benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

-    We present SSOD -- the first end-to-end analysis-by-synthesis framework with controllable GANs for the task of self-supervised object detection. We use collections of real-world images without bounding box annotations to learn to synthesize and detect objects. We leverage controllable GANs to synthesize images with pre-defined object properties and use them to train object detectors. We propose a tight end-to-end coupling of the synthesis and detection networks to optimally train our system. Finally, we also propose a method to optimally adapt SSOD to an intended target data without requiring labels for it. For the task of car detection, on the challenging KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, we show that SSOD outperforms the prior state-of-the-art purely image-based self-supervised object detection method Wetectron. Even without requiring any 3DCAD assets, it also surpasses the state-of-the-art rendering-based method Meta-Sim2. Our work advances the field of self-supervised object detection by introducing a successful new paradigm of using controllable GAN-based image synthesis for it and by significantly improving the base-line accuracy of the task.

-    In this paper, we study the problem of Novel Class Discovery (NCD). NCD aims at inferring novel object categories in an unlabeled set by leveraging from prior knowledge of a labeled set containing different, but related classes. Existing approaches tackle this problem by considering multiple objective functions, usually involving specialized loss terms for the labeled and the unlabeled samples respectively, and often requiring auxiliary regularization terms. In this paper, we depart from this traditional scheme and introduce a UNified Objective function (UNO) for discovering novel classes, with the explicit purpose of favoring synergy between supervised and unsupervised learning. Using a multi-view self-labeling strategy, we generate pseudo-labels that can be treated homogeneously with ground truth labels. This leads to a single classification objective operating on both known and unknown classes. Despite its simplicity, UNO outperforms the state of the art by a significant margin on several benchmarks (approximately +10% on CIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet). Our source code will be publicly available. The project page is available at: https://ncd-uno.github.io.

-    We study a crucial problem in video analysis: human-object relationship detection. The majority of previous approaches are developed only for the static image scenario, without incorporating the temporal dynamics so vital to contextualizing human-object relationships. We propose a model with Intra- and Inter-Transformers, enabling joint spatial and temporal reasoning on multiple visual concepts of objects, relationships, and human poses. We find that applying attention mechanisms among features distributed spatio-temporally greatly improves our understanding of human-object relationships. Our method is validated on two datasets, Action Genome and CAD-120-EVAR, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both of them.

-    Top-k multi-label learning, which returns the top-k predicted labels from an input, has many practical applications such as image annotation, document analysis, and web search engine. However, the vulnerabilities of such algorithms with regards to dedicated adversarial perturbation attacks have not been extensively studied previously. In this work, we develop methods to create adversarial perturbations that can be used to attack top-k multi-label learning-based image annotation systems (T_kML-AP). Our methods explicitly consider the top-k ranking relation and are based on novel loss functions. Experimental evaluations on large-scale benchmark datasets including PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in reducing the performance of state-of-the-art top-k multi-label learning methods, under both untargeted and targeted attacks.

-    For high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, bitemporal supervised learning always dominates change detection using many pairwise labeled bitemporal images. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection from a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired images as supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired labeled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal images. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architecture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive experimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large margin under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance under bitemporal supervision.

-    Existing state-of-the-art saliency detection methods heavily rely on CNN-based architectures. Alternatively, we rethink this task from a convolution-free sequence-to-sequence perspective and predict saliency by modeling long-range dependencies, which can not be achieved by convolution. Specifically, we develop a novel unified model based on a pure transformer, namely, Visual Saliency Transformer (VST), for both RGB and RGB-D salient object detection (SOD). It takes image patches as inputs and leverages the transformer to propagate global contexts among image patches. Unlike conventional architectures used in Vision Transformer (ViT), we leverage multi-level token fusion and propose a new token upsampling method under the transformer framework to get high-resolution detection results. We also develop a token-based multi-task decoder to simultaneously perform saliency and boundary detection by introducing task-related tokens and a novel patch-task-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods on both RGB and RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets. Most importantly, our whole framework not only provides a new perspective for the SOD field but also shows a new paradigm for transformer-based dense prediction models.

-    Most prior works on physical adversarial attacks mainly focus on the attack performance but seldom enforce any restrictions over the appearance of the generated adversarial patches. This leads to conspicuous and attention-grabbing patterns for the generated patches which can be easily identified by humans. To address this issue, we propose a method to craft physical adversarial patches for object detectors by leveraging the learned image manifold of a pretrained generative adversarial network (GAN) (e.g., BigGAN and StyleGAN) upon real-world images. Through sampling the optimal image from the GAN, our method can generate natural looking adversarial patches while maintaining high attack performance. With extensive experiments on both digital and physical domains and several independent subjective surveys, the results show that our proposed method produces significantly more realistic and natural looking patches than several state-of-the-art baselines while achieving competitive attack performance.

-    This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

-    3D object grounding aims to locate the most relevant target object in a raw point cloud scene based on a free-form language description. Understanding complex and diverse descriptions, and lifting them directly to a point cloud is a new and challenging topic due to the irregular and sparse nature of point clouds. There are three main challenges in 3D object grounding: to find the main focus in the complex and diverse description; to understand the point cloud scene; and to locate the target object. In this paper, we address all three challenges. Firstly, we propose a language scene graph module to capture the rich structure and long-distance phrase correlations. Secondly, we introduce a multi-level 3D proposal relation graph module to extract the object-object and object-scene co-occurrence relationships, and strengthen the visual features of the initial proposals. Lastly, we develop a description guided 3D visual graph module to encode global contexts of phrases and proposals by a nodes matching strategy. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets (ScanRefer and Nr3D) show that our algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art.

-    Low-cost monocular 3D object detection plays a fundamental role in autonomous driving, whereas its accuracy is still far from satisfactory. Our objective is to dig into the 3D object detection task and reformulate it as the sub-tasks of object localization and appearance perception, which benefits to a deep excavation of reciprocal information underlying the entire task. We introduce a Dynamic Feature Reflecting Network, named DFR-Net, which contains two novel standalone modules: (i) the Appearance-Localization Feature Reflecting module (ALFR) that first separates task-specific features and then self-mutually reflects the reciprocal features; (ii) the Dynamic Intra-Trading module (DIT) that adaptively realigns the training processes of various sub-tasks via a self-learning manner. Extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of DFR-Net. We rank 1st among all the monocular 3D object detectors in the KITTI test set (till March 16th, 2021). The proposed method is also easy to be plug-and-play in many cutting-edge 3D detection frameworks at negligible cost to boost performance. The code will be made publicly available.

-    This paper presents a Simple and effective unsupervised adaptation method for Robust Object Detection (SimROD). To overcome the challenging issues of domain shift and pseudo-label noise, our method integrates a novel domain-centric data augmentation, a gradual self-labeling adaptation procedure, and a teacher-guided fine-tuning mechanism. Using our method, target domain samples can be leveraged to adapt object detection models without changing the model architecture or generating synthetic data. When applied to image corruptions and high-level cross-domain adaptation benchmarks, our method outperforms prior baselines on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. SimROD achieves new state-of-the-art on standard real-to-synthetic and cross-camera setup benchmarks. On the image corruption benchmark, models adapted with our method achieved a relative robustness improvement of 15-25% AP50 on Pascal-C and 5-6% AP on COCO-C and Cityscapes-C. On the cross-domain benchmark, our method outperformed the best baseline performance by up to 8% and 4% AP50 on Comic and Watercolor respectively.

-    Today's state-of-the-art methods for 3D object detection are based on lidar, stereo, or monocular cameras. Lidar-based methods achieve the best accuracy, but have a large footprint, high cost, and mechanically-limited angular sampling rates, resulting in low spatial resolution at long ranges. Recent approaches using low-cost monocular or stereo cameras promise to overcome these limitations but struggle in low-light or low-contrast regions as they rely on passive CMOS sensors. We propose a novel 3D object detection modality that exploits temporal illumination cues from a low-cost monocular gated imager. We introduce a novel deep detection architecture, Gated3D, that is tailored to temporal illumination cues in gated images. This modality allows us to exploit mature 2D object feature extractors that guide the 3D predictions through a frustum segment estimation. We assess the proposed method experimentally on a 3D detection dataset that includes gated images captured over 10,000 km of driving data. We validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art monocular and stereo methods, opening up a new sensor modality as an avenue to replace lidar in autonomous driving. https://light.princeton.edu/gated3d

-    Few-shot semantic segmentation aims at learning to segment a target object from a query image using only a few annotated support images of the target class. This challenging task requires to understand diverse levels of visual cues and analyze fine-grained correspondence relations between the query and the support images. To address the problem, we propose Hypercorrelation Squeeze Networks (HSNet) that leverages multi-level feature correlation and efficient 4D convolutions. It extracts diverse features from different levels of intermediate convolutional layers and constructs a collection of 4D correlation tensors, i.e., hypercorrelations. Using efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions in a pyramidal architecture, the method gradually squeezes high-level semantic and low-level geometric cues of the hypercorrelation into precise segmentation masks in coarse-to-fine manner. The significant performance improvements on standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks of PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000 verify the efficacy of the proposed method.

-    DETR is a recently proposed Transformer-based method which views object detection as a set prediction problem and achieves state-of-the-art performance but demands extra-long training time to converge. In this paper, we investigate the causes of the optimization difficulty in the training of DETR. Our examinations reveal several factors contributing to the slow convergence of DETR, primarily the issues with the Hungarian loss and the Transformer cross attention mechanism. To overcome these issues we propose two solutions, namely, TSP-FCOS (Transformer-based Set Prediction with FCOS) and TSP-RCNN (Transformer-based Set Prediction with RCNN). Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only converge much faster than the original DETR, but also significantly outperform DETR and other baselines in terms of detection accuracy.

-    We tackle the problem of monocular 3D reconstruction of articulated objects like humans and animals. Our key contribution is DensePose 3D, a novel parametric model of an articulated mesh, which can be learned in a self-supervised fashion from 2D image annotations only. This is in stark contrast with previous human body reconstruction methods that utilize a parametric model like SMPL pre-trained on a large dataset of 3D body scans that had to be obtained in a controlled environment. DensePose 3D can thus be applied for modelling broad range of articulated categories such as animal species. In an end-to-end fashion, it automatically learns to softly assign each vertex of a category-specific 3D template mesh to one of the rigidly moving latent parts and trains a single-view network predicting rigid motions of the parts to deform the template so that it re-projects correctly to the dense 2D surface annotations of objects (such as DensePose). In order to prevent unrealistic template deformations, we further propose to align the motions of nearby mesh vertices by expressing the part assignment as a function of the smooth eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator computed on the template mesh. Our experiments demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art non-rigid structure-from-motion baselines on both synthetic and real data on categories of humans and animals.

-    Monocular object detection and tracking have improved drastically in recent years, but rely on a key assumption: that objects are visible to the camera. Many offline tracking approaches reason about occluded objects post-hoc, by linking together tracklets after the object re-appears, making use of reidentification (ReID). However, online tracking in embodied robotic agents (such as a self-driving vehicle) fundamentally requires object permanence, which is the ability to reason about occluded objects before they re-appear. In this work, we re-purpose tracking benchmarks and propose new metrics for the task of detecting invisible objects, focusing on the illustrative case of people. We demonstrate that current detection and tracking systems perform dramatically worse on this task. We introduce two key innovations to recover much of this performance drop. We treat occluded object detection in temporal sequences as a short-term forecasting challenge, bringing to bear tools from dynamic sequence prediction. Second, we build dynamic models that explicitly reason in 3D from monocular videos without calibration, using observations produced by monocular depth estimators. To our knowledge, ours is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of monocular depth estimation for the task of tracking and detecting occluded objects. Our approach strongly improves by 11.4% over the baseline in ablations and by 5.0% over the state-of-the-art in F1 score.

-    Visual tracking has achieved considerable progress in recent years. However, current research in the field mainly focuses on tracking of opaque objects, while little attention is paid to transparent object tracking. In this paper, we make the first attempt in exploring this problem by proposing a Transparent Object Tracking Benchmark (TOTB). Specifically, TOTB consists of 225 videos (86K frames) from 15 diverse transparent object categories. Each sequence is manually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes. To the best of our knowledge, TOTB is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object tracking. In order to understand how existing trackers perform and to provide comparison for future research on TOTB, we extensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The evaluation results exhibit that more efforts are needed to improve transparent object tracking. Besides, we observe some nontrivial findings from the evaluation that are discrepant with some common beliefs in opaque object tracking. For example, we find that deep(er) features are not always good for improvements. Moreover, to encourage future research, we introduce a novel tracker, named TransATOM, which leverages transparency features for tracking and surpasses all 25 evaluated approaches by a large margin. By releasing TOTB, we expect to facilitate future research and application of transparent object tracking in both the academia and industry. The TOTB and evaluation results as well as TransATOM are available at https://hengfan2010.github.io/projects/TOTB/.

##### Boosting Weakly Supervised Object Detection via Learning Bounding Box Adjusters

-    Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) has emerged as an inspiring recent topic to avoid expensive instance-level object annotations. However, the bounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly determined by precomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization. In this paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization performance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a well-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary dataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a multi-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training LBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and economical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary well-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage training algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for LBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve proposal classification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods and knowledge transfer model with similar problem setting.

##### CaT: Weakly Supervised Object Detection With Category Transfer

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Cao_CaT_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Detection_With_Category_Transfer_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    A large gap exists between fully-supervised object detection and weakly-supervised object detection. To narrow this gap, some methods consider knowledge transfer from additional fully-supervised dataset. But these methods do not fully exploit discriminative category information in the fully-supervised dataset, thus causing low mAP. To solve this issue, we propose a novel category transfer framework for weakly supervised object detection. The intuition is to fully leverage both visually-discriminative and semantically-correlated category information in the fully-supervised dataset to enhance the object-classification ability of a weakly-supervised detector. To handle overlapping category transfer, we propose a double-supervision mean teacher to gather common category information and bridge the domain gap between two datasets. To handle non-overlapping category transfer, we propose a semantic graph convolutional network to promote the aggregation of semantic features between correlated categories. Experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-supervised dataset and COCO as the source fully-supervised dataset. Our category transfer framework achieves 63.5% mAP and 80.3% CorLoc with 5 overlapping categories between two datasets, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jain_Scaling_Semantic_Segmentation_Beyond_1K_Classes_on_a_Single_GPU_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The state-of-the-art object detection and image classification methods can perform impressively on more than 9k and 10k classes respectively. In contrast, the number of classes in semantic segmentation datasets is relatively limited. This is not surprising when the restrictions caused by the lack of labelled data and high computation demand for segmentation are considered. In this paper, we propose a novel training methodology to train and scale the existing semantic segmentation models for a large number of semantic classes without increasing the memory overhead. In our approach, we reduce the space complexity of the segmentation model's output from O(C) to O(1), propose an approximation method for ground-truth class probability, and use it to compute cross-entropy loss. The proposed approach is general and can be adopted by any state-of-the-art segmentation model to gracefully scale it for any number of semantic classes with only one GPU. Our approach achieves similar, and in some cases even better mIoU for Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and ADE20k dataset when adopted to DeeplabV3+ model with different backbones. We demonstrate a clear benefit of our approach on a dataset with 1284 classes, bootstrapped from LVIS and COCO annotations, with almost three times better mIoU when compared to DeeplabV3+.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Dai_Dynamic_DETR_End-to-End_Object_Detection_With_Dynamic_Attention_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    In this paper, we present a novel Dynamic DETR (Detection with Transformers) approach by introducing dynamic attentions into both the encoder and decoder stages of DETR to break its two limitations on small feature resolution and slow training convergence. To address the first limitation, which is due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention module in Transformer encoders, we propose a dynamic encoder  to approximate the Transformer encoder's attention mechanism using a convolution-based dynamic encoder with various attention types. Such an encoder can dynamically adjust attentions based on multiple factors such as scale importance, spatial importance, and representation (i.e., feature dimension) importance. To mitigate the second limitation of learning difficulty, we introduce a dynamic decoder  by replacing the cross-attention module with a ROI-based dynamic attention in the Transformer decoder. Such a decoder effectively assists Transformers to focus on region of interests from a coarse-to-fine manner and dramatically lowers the learning difficulty, leading to a much faster convergence with fewer training epochs. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate our advantages. Our Dynamic DETR significantly reduces the training epochs (by  \bf 14x  ), yet results in a much better performance (by  \bf 3.6 on mAP). Meanwhile, in the standard  1x  setup with ResNet-50 backbone, we archive a new state-of-the-art performance that further proves the learning effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code will be released soon.

##### Solving Inefficiency of Self-Supervised Representation Learning

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Solving_Inefficiency_of_Self-Supervised_Representation_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted great interest due to its huge potential in learning discriminative representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes, existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency, e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we reveal two contradictory phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency. Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object classes. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn features from excessive negative sample pairs, forcing the model to over-cluster samples of the same actual classes into different clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework using a truncated triplet loss. Precisely, we employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and we construct the negative pair by selecting a negative sample deputy from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively evaluate our framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO). The results demonstrate our model's superiority (e.g., the learning efficiency) over the latest state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. See Codes at: https://github.com/wanggrun/triplet.

-    Attention mechanism, especially channel attention, has gained great success in the computer vision field. Many works focus on how to design efficient channel attention mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e., channel attention mechanism uses scalar to represent channel, which is difficult due to massive information loss. In this work, we start from a different view and regard the channel representation problem as a compression process using frequency analysis. Based on the frequency analysis, we mathematically prove that the conventional global average pooling is a special case of the feature decomposition in the frequency domain. With the proof, we naturally generalize the compression of the channel attention mechanism in the frequency domain and propose our method with multi-spectral channel attention, termed as FcaNet. FcaNet is simple but effective. We can change a few lines of code in the calculation to implement our method within existing channel attention methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared with other channel attention methods on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Our method could consistently outperform the baseline SENet, with the same number of parameters and the same computational cost. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/cfzd/FcaNet.

-    Self-attention networks have revolutionized natural language processing and are making impressive strides in image analysis tasks such as image classification and object detection. Inspired by this success, we investigate the application of self-attention networks to 3D point cloud processing. We design self-attention layers for point clouds and use these to construct self-attention networks for tasks such as semantic scene segmentation, object part segmentation, and object classification. Our Point Transformer design improves upon prior work across domains and tasks. For example, on the challenging S3DIS dataset for large-scale semantic scene segmentation, the Point Transformer attains an mIoU of 70.4% on Area 5, outperforming the strongest prior model by 3.3 absolute percentage points and crossing the 70% mIoU threshold for the first time.

-    How to make the appearance and motion information interact effectively to accommodate complex scenarios is a fundamental issue in flow-based zero-shot video object segmentation. In this paper, we propose an Attentive Multi-Modality Collaboration Network (AMC-Net) to utilize appearance and motion information uniformly. Specifically, AMC-Net fuses robust information from multi-modality features and promotes their collaboration in two stages. First, we propose a Multi-Modality Co-Attention Gate (MCG) on the bilateral encoder branches, in which a gate function is used to formulate co-attention scores for balancing the contributions of multi-modality features and suppressing the redundant and misleading information. Then, we propose a Motion Correction Module (MCM) with a visual-motion attention mechanism, which is constructed to emphasize the features of foreground objects by incorporating the spatio-temporal correspondence between appearance and motion cues. Extensive experiments on three public challenging benchmark datasets verify that our proposed network performs favorably against existing state-of-the-art methods via training with fewer data.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Qiu_CrossDet_Crossline_Representation_for_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Object detection aims to accurately locate and classify objects in an image, which requires precise object representations. Existing methods usually use rectangular anchor boxes or a set of points to represent objects. However, these methods either introduce background noise or miss the continuous appearance information inside the object, and thus cause incorrect detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-free object detection network, called CrossDet, which uses a set of growing cross lines along horizontal and vertical axes as object representations. An object can be flexibly represented as cross lines in different combinations. It not only can effectively reduce the interference of noise, but also takes into account the continuous object information, which is useful to enhance the discriminability of object features and find the object boundaries. Based on the learned cross lines, we propose a crossline extraction module to adaptively capture features of cross lines. Furthermore, we design a decoupled regression mechanism to regress the localization along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively, which helps to decrease the optimization difficulty because the optimization space is limited to a specific direction. Our method achieves consistently improvement on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

##### Robust Object Detection via Instance-Level Temporal Cycle Confusion

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Robust_Object_Detection_via_Instance-Level_Temporal_Cycle_Confusion_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Building reliable object detectors that are robust to domain shifts, such as various changes in context, viewpoint, and object appearances, is critical for real-world applications. In this work, we study the effectiveness of auxiliary self-supervised tasks to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of object detectors. Inspired by the principle of maximum entropy, we introduce a novel self-supervised task, instance-level temporal cycle confusion (CycConf), which operates on the region features of the object detectors. For each object, the task is to find the most different object proposals in the adjacent frame in a video and then cycle back to itself for self-supervision. CycConf encourages the object detector to explore invariant structures across instances under various motions, which leads to improved model robustness in unseen domains at test time. We observe consistent out-of-domain performance improvements when training object detectors in tandem with self-supervised tasks on various domain adaptation benchmarks with static images (Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, Sim10K) and large-scale video datasets (BDD100K and Waymo open data). The code and models are released at https://xinw.ai/cyc-conf.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Khirodkar_Multi-Instance_Pose_Networks_Rethinking_Top-Down_Pose_Estimation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    A key assumption of top-down human pose estimation approaches is their expectation of having a single person/instance present in the input bounding box. This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption. Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-Instance Modulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for each instance and is parameter efficient. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Specifically, we achieve 70.0 AP on CrowdPose and 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, a significant improvement of 2.4 AP and 6.5 AP over the prior art, respectively. When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet achieves an improvement of 0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 AP on CrowdPose, and 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets compared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high confidence bounding boxes are used, HRNet's performance degrades (by 5 AP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet maintains a relatively stable performance (drop of 1 AP) for the same inputs.

-    Autonomous systems need to understand the semantics and geometry of their surroundings in order to comprehend and safely execute object-level task specifications. This paper proposes an expressive yet compact model for joint object pose and shape optimization, and an associated optimization algorithm to infer an object-level map from multi-view RGB-D camera observations. The model is expressive because it captures the identities, positions, orientations, and shapes of objects in the environment. It is compact because it relies on a low-dimensional latent representation of implicit object shape, allowing onboard storage of large multi-category object maps. Different from other works that rely on a single object representation format, our approach has a bi-level object model that captures both the coarse level scale as well as the fine level shape details. Our approach is evaluated on the large-scale real-world ScanNet dataset and compared against state-of-the-art methods.

##### Vision-Language Transformer and Query Generation for Referring Segmentation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ding_Vision-Language_Transformer_and_Query_Generation_for_Referring_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    In this work, we address the challenging task of referring segmentation. The query expression in referring segmentation typically indicates the target object by describing its relationship with others. Therefore, to find the target one among all instances in the image, the model must have a holistic understanding of the whole image. To achieve this, we reformulate referring segmentation as a direct attention problem: finding the region in the image where the query language expression is most attended to. We introduce transformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder attention mechanism architecture that "queries" the given image with the language expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which produces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that represent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from different aspects. At the same time, to find the best way from these diversified comprehensions based on visual clues, we further propose a Query Balance Module to adaptively select the output features of these queries for a better mask generation. Without bells and whistles, our approach is light-weight and achieves new state-of-the-art performance consistently on three referring segmentation datasets, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref.

-    To date, various 3D scene understanding tasks still lack practical and generalizable pre-trained models, primarily due to the intricate nature of 3D scene understanding tasks and their immerse variations due to camera views, lighting, occlusions, etc. In this paper, we tackle this immanent challenge by introducing a spatio-temporal representation learning (STRL) framework, capable of learning from unlabeled 3D point clouds in a self-supervised fashion. Inspired by how infants learn from visual data in-the-wild, we explore the rich spatio-temporal cues derived from the 3D data. Specifically, STRL takes two temporal-correlated frames from a 3D point cloud sequence as the input, transforms it with spatial data augmentation, and learns the invariant representation self-supervisedly. To corroborate the efficacy of STRL, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic, indoor, and outdoor datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with supervised learning methods, the learned self-supervised representation facilitates various models to attain comparable or even better performances while capable of generalizing pre-trained models to downstream tasks, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation. Moreover, spatio-temporal contextual cues embedded in 3D point clouds significantly improve the learned representations.

-    Inspired by the complementarity between conventional frame-based and bio-inspired event-based cameras, we propose a multi-modal based approach to fuse visual cues from the frame- and event-domain to enhance the single object tracking performance, especially in degraded conditions (e.g., scenes with high dynamic range, low light, and fast-motion objects). The proposed approach can effectively and adaptively combine meaningful information from both domains. Our approach's effectiveness is enforced by a novel designed cross-domain attention schemes, which can effectively enhance features based on self- and cross-domain attention schemes; The adaptiveness is guarded by a specially designed weighting scheme, which can adaptively balance the contribution of the two domains. To exploit event-based visual cues in single-object tracking, we construct a large-scale frame-event-based dataset, which we subsequently employ to train a novel frame-event fusion based model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art frame-based tracking methods by at least 10.4% and 11.9% in terms of representative success rate and precision rate, respectively. Besides, the effectiveness of each key component of our approach is evidenced by our thorough ablation study.

-    Most weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods follow the pipeline that generates pseudo-masks initially and trains the segmentation model with the pseudo-masks in fully supervised manner after. However, we find some matters related to the pseudo-masks, including high quality pseudo-masks generation from class activation maps (CAMs), and training with noisy pseudo-mask supervision. For these matters, we propose the following designs to push the performance to new state-of-art: (i) Coefficient of Variation Smoothing to smooth the CAMs adaptively; (ii) Proportional Pseudo-mask Generation to project the expanded CAMs to pseudo-mask based on a new metric indicating the importance of each class on each location, instead of the scores trained from binary classifiers. (iii) Pretended Under-Fitting strategy to suppress the influence of noise in pseudo-mask; (iv) Cyclic Pseudo-mask to boost the pseudo-masks during training of fully supervised semantic segmentation (FSSS). Experiments based on our methods achieve new state-of-art results on two changeling weakly supervised semantic segmentation datasets, pushing the mIoU to 70.0% and 40.2% on PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 respectively.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_End-to-End_Semi-Supervised_Object_Detection_With_Soft_Teacher_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Previous pseudo-label approaches for semi-supervised object detection typically follow a multi-stage schema, with the first stage to train an initial detector on a few labeled data, followed by the pseudo labeling and re-training stage on unlabeled data. These multi-stage methods complicate the training, and also hinder the use of improved detectors for more accurate pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach to simultaneously improve the detector and pseudo labels gradually for semi-supervised object detection. The pseudo labels are generated on the fly by a teacher model which is an aggregated version of the student detector at different steps. As the detector becomes stronger during the training, the teacher detector's performance improves and the pseudo labels tend to be more accurate, which further benefits the detector training. Within the end-to-end training, we present two simple yet effective techniques: weigh the classification loss of unlabeled images through soft teacher and select reliable pseudo boxes for regression through box jittering. Experimentally, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on MS-COCO benchmark by using Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 and FPN, reaching 20.5 mAP, 30.7 mAP and 34.0 mAP with 1%, 5%, 10% labeled data, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach also proves to improve this detector trained on the COCO full set by +1.8 mAP by leveraging additional unlabelled data of COCO, achieving 42.7 mAP.

-    In this paper, we propose a novel solution for object-matching based semi-supervised video object segmentation, where the target object masks in the first frame are provided. Existing object-matching based methods focus on the matching between the raw object features of the current frame and the first/previous frames. However, two issues are still not solved by these object-matching based methods. As the appearance of the video object changes drastically over time, 1) unseen parts/details of the object present in the current frame, resulting in incomplete annotation in the first annotated frame (e.g., view/scale changes). 2) even for the seen parts/details of the object in the current frame, their positions change relatively (e.g., pose changes/camera motion), leading to a misalignment for the object matching. To obtain the complete information of the target object, we propose a novel object-based dynamic memory network that exploits visual contents of all the past frames. To solve the misalignment problem caused by position changes of visual contents, we propose an adaptive object alignment module by incorporating a region translation function that aligns object proposals towards templates in the feature space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on latest benchmark datasets DAVIS 2017 (J of 81.4% and F of 87.5% on the validation set) and YouTube-VOS (the overall score of 82.7% on the validation set) with a very efficient inference time (0.16 second/frame on DAVIS 2017 validation set).

-    Pseudo-LiDAR-based methods for monocular 3D object detection have received considerable attention in the community due to the performance gains exhibited on the KITTI3D benchmark, in particular on the commonly reported validation split. This generated a distorted impression about the superiority of Pseudo-LiDAR-based (PL-based) approaches over methods working with RGB images only. Our first contribution consists in rectifying this view by pointing out and showing experimentally that the validation results published by PL-based methods are substantially biased. The source of the bias resides in an overlap between the KITTI3D object detection validation set and the training/validation sets used to train depth predictors feeding PL-based methods. Surprisingly, the bias remains also after geographically removing the overlap. This leaves the test set as the only reliable set for comparison, where published PL-based methods do not excel. Our second contribution brings PL-based methods back up in the ranking with the design of a novel deep architecture which introduces a 3D confidence prediction module. We show that 3D confidence estimation techniques derived from RGB-only 3D detection approaches can be successfully integrated into our framework and, more importantly, that improved performance can be obtained with a newly designed 3D confidence measure, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI3D benchmark.

-    Many objects do not appear frequently enough in complex scenes (e.g., certain handbags in living rooms) for training an accurate object detector, but are often found frequently by themselves (e.g., in product images). Yet, these object-centric images are not effectively leveraged for improving object detection in scene-centric images. In this paper, we propose Mosaic of Object-centric images as Scene-centric images (MosaicOS), a simple and novel framework that is surprisingly effective at tackling the challenges of long-tailed object detection. Keys to our approach are three-fold: (i) pseudo scene-centric image construction from object-centric images for mitigating domain differences, (ii) high-quality bounding box imputation using the object-centric images' class labels, and (iii) a multi-stage training procedure. On LVIS object detection (and instance segmentation), MosaicOS leads to a massive 60% (and 23%) relative improvement in average precision for rare object categories. We also show that our framework can be compatibly used with other existing approaches to achieve even further gains. Our pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/czhang0528/MosaicOS/.

-    In autonomous driving, a LiDAR-based object detector should perform reliably at different geographic locations and under various weather conditions. While recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain Adaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at the predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors.  To validate the wide applicability of SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.  On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI, SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories. Combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on KITTI.

-    Data augmentation has been an indispensable tool to improve the performance of deep neural networks, however the augmentation can hardly transfer among different tasks and datasets. Consequently, a recent trend is to adopt AutoML technique to learn proper augmentation policy without extensive hand-crafted tuning. In this paper, we propose an efficient differentiable search algorithm called Direct Differentiable Augmentation Search (DDAS). It utilizes meta-learning with one-step gradient update and continuous relaxation to the expected training loss for efficient search. Our DDAS could achieve efficient augmentation search without approximations such as Gumbel-Softmax or second order gradient approximation. To further reduce the adverse effect of improper augmentations, we organize the search space into a two level hierarchy, in which we first decide whether to apply augmentation, and then determine the specific augmentation policy. On standard image classification benchmarks, our DDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency tradeoff while reducing the search cost dramatically, e.g. 0.15 GPU hours for CIFAR-10. In addition, we also use DDAS to search augmentation for object detection task and achieve comparable performance with AutoAugment, while being 1000x faster. Code will be released in https://github.com/zxcvfd13502/DDAS_code.

-    We introduce the task of weakly supervised learning for detecting human and object interactions in videos. Our task poses unique challenges as a system does not know what types of human-object interactions are present in a video or the actual spatiotemporal location of the human and object. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive weakly supervised training loss that aims to jointly associate spatiotemporal regions in a video with an action and object vocabulary and encourage temporal continuity of the visual appearance of moving objects as a form of self-supervision. To train our model, we introduce a dataset comprising over 6.5k videos with human-object interaction annotations that have been semi-automatically curated from sentence captions associated with the videos. We demonstrate improved performance over weakly supervised baselines adapted to our task on our video dataset.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Unidentified_Video_Objects_A_Benchmark_for_Dense_Open-World_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Current state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation methods work well under the closed-world assumption. This closed-world setting assumes that the list of object categories is available during training and deployment. However, many real-world applications require detecting or segmenting novel objects, i.e., object categories never seen during training. In this paper, we present, UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. Besides shifting the focus to the open-world setup, UVO is significantly larger, providing approximately 6 times more videos compared with DAVIS, and 7 times more mask (instance) annotations per video compared with YouTube-VO(I)S. UVO is also more challenging as it includes many videos with crowded scenes and complex background motions. We also demonstrated that UVO can be used for other applications, such as object tracking and super-voxel segmentation. We believe that UVO is a versatile testbed for researchers to develop novel approaches for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation, and inspires new research directions towards a more comprehensive video understanding beyond classification and detection.

-    Images tell powerful stories but cannot always be trusted. Matching images back to trusted sources (attribution) enables users to make a more informed judgment of the images they encounter online. We propose a robust image hashing algorithm to perform such matching. Our hash is sensitive to manipulation of subtle, salient visual details that can substantially change the story told by an image. Yet the hash is invariant to benign transformations (changes in quality, codecs, sizes, shapes, etc.) experienced by images during online redistribution. Our key contribution is OSCAR-Net (Object-centric Scene Graph Attention for Image Attribution Network); a robust image hashing model inspired by recent successes of Transformers in the visual domain. OSCAR-Net constructs a scene graph representation that attends to fine-grained changes of every object's visual appearance and their spatial relationships. The network is trained via contrastive learning on a dataset of original and manipulated images yielding a state of the art image hash for content fingerprinting that scales to millions of images.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Nguyen_A_Weakly_Supervised_Amodal_Segmenter_With_Boundary_Uncertainty_Estimation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    This paper addresses weakly supervised amodal instance segmentation, where the goal is to segment both visible and occluded (amodal) object parts, while training provides only ground-truth visible (modal) segmentations. Following prior work, we use data manipulation to generate occlusions in training images and thus train a segmenter to predict amodal segmentations of the manipulated data. The resulting predictions on training images are taken as the pseudo-ground truth for the standard training of Mask-RCNN, which we use for amodal instance segmentation of test images. For generating the pseudo-ground truth, we specify a new Amodal Segmenter based on Boundary Uncertainty estimation (ASBU) and make two contributions. First, while prior work uses the occluder's mask, our ASBU uses the occlusion boundary as input. Second, ASBU estimates an uncertainty map of the prediction. The estimated uncertainty regularizes learning such that lower segmentation loss is incurred on regions with high uncertainty. ASBU achieves significant performance improvement relative to the state of the art on the COCOA and KINS datasets in three tasks: amodal instance segmentation, amodal completion, and ordering recovery.

-    Glass-like objects such as windows, bottles, and mirrors exist widely in the real world. Sensing these objects has many applications, including robot navigation and grasping. However, this task is very challenging due to the arbitrary scenes behind glass-like objects. This paper aims to solve the glass-like object segmentation problem via enhanced boundary learning. In particular, we first propose a novel refined differential module that outputs finer boundary cues. We then introduce an edge-aware point-based graph convolution network module to model the global shape along the boundary. We use these two modules to design a decoder that generates accurate and clean segmentation results, especially on the object contours. Both modules are lightweight and effective: they can be embedded into various segmentation models. In extensive experiments on three recent glass-like object segmentation datasets, including Trans10k, MSD, and GDD, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results. We also illustrate the strong generalization properties of our method on three generic segmentation datasets, including Cityscapes, BDD, and COCO Stuff. Code and models will be available for further research.

-    Pretraining on large labeled datasets is a prerequisite to achieve good performance in many computer vision tasks like image recognition, video understanding etc. However, pretraining is not widely used for 3D recognition tasks where state-of-the-art methods train models from scratch. A primary reason is the lack of large annotated datasets because 3D data labelling is time-consuming. Recent work shows that self-supervised learning is useful to pretrain models in 3D but requires multi-view data and point correspondences. We present a simple self-supervised pretraining method that can work with single-view depth scans acquired by varied sensors, without 3D registration and point correspondences. We pretrain standard point cloud and voxel based model architectures, and show that joint pretraining further improves performance. We evaluate our models on 9 benchmarks for object detection, semantic segmentation, and object classification, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. Most notably, we set a new state-of-the-art for object detection on ScanNet (69.0% mAP) and SUNRGBD (63.5% mAP). Our pretrained models are label efficient and improve performance for classes with few examples.

-    We introduce N-ImageNet, a large-scale dataset targeted for robust, fine-grained object recognition with event cameras. The dataset is collected using programmable hardware in which an event camera consistently moves around a monitor displaying images from ImageNet. N-ImageNet serves as a challenging benchmark for event-based object recognition, due to its large number of classes and samples. We empirically show that pretraining on N-ImageNet improves the performance of event-based classifiers and helps them learn with few labeled data. In addition, we present several variants of N-ImageNet to test the robustness of event-based classifiers under diverse camera trajectories and severe lighting conditions, and propose a novel event representation to alleviate the performance degradation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively investigate the consequences caused by various environmental conditions on event-based object recognition algorithms. N-ImageNet and its variants are expected to guide practical implementations for deploying event-based object recognition algorithms in the real world.

##### Region Similarity Representation Learning
- [Back to List](#iccv)
- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xiao_Region_Similarity_Representation_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We present Region Similarity Representation Learning (ReSim), a new approach to self-supervised representation learning for localization-based tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While existing work has largely focused on learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps; this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: +2:7 APbb75 VOC, +1:1 AP75 COCO, and +1:9 APmk Cityscapes. We will release our code and pre-trained models.

-    Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers the dark knowledge from cumbersome networks (teacher) to lightweight (student) networks and expects the student to achieve more promising performance than training without the teacher's knowledge. However, a counter-intuitive argument is that better teachers do not make better students due to the capacity mismatch. To this end, we present a novel adaptive knowledge distillation method to complement traditional approaches. The proposed method, named as Student Customized Knowledge Distillation (SCKD), examines the capacity mismatch between teacher and student from the perspective of gradient similarity. We formulate the knowledge distillation as a multi-task learning problem so that the teacher transfers knowledge to the student only if the student can benefit from learning such knowledge. We validate our methods on multiple datasets with various teacher-student configurations on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

-    We present a dual-pathway approach for recognizing fine-grained interactions from videos. We build on the success of prior dual-stream approaches, but make a distinction between the static and dynamic representations of objects and their interactions explicit by introducing separate motion and object detection pathways. Then, using our new Motion-Guided Attention Fusion module, we fuse the bottom-up features in the motion pathway with features captured from object detections to learn the temporal aspects of an action. We show that our approach can generalize across appearance effectively and recognize actions where an actor interacts with previously unseen objects. We validate our approach using the compositional action recognition task from the Something-Something-v2 dataset where we outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. We also show that our method can generalize well to real world tasks by showing state-of-the-art performance on recognizing humans assembling various IKEA furniture on the IKEA-ASM dataset.

-    Knowledge distillation (KD) has been proven a simple and effective tool for training compact dense prediction models. Lightweight student networks are trained by extra supervision transferred from large teacher networks. Most previous KD variants for dense prediction tasks align the activation maps from the student and teacher network in the spatial domain, typically by normalizing the activation values on each spatial location and minimizing point-wise and/or pair-wise discrepancy. Different from the previous methods, here we propose to normalize the activation map of each channel to obtain a soft probability map. By simply minimizing the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between the channel-wise probability map of the two networks, the distillation process pays more attention to the most salient regions of each channel, which are valuable for dense prediction tasks. We conduct experiments on a few dense prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation and object detection. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art distillation methods considerably, and can require less computational cost during training. In particular, we improve the RetinaNet detector (ResNet50backbone) by3.4%in mAP on the COCO dataset and spent (ResNet18 backbone) by5.81%in mIoU on the cityscapes dataset.

-    Implicit neural rendering techniques have shown promising results for novel view synthesis. However, existing methods usually encode the entire scene as a whole, which is generally not aware of the object identity and limits the ability to the high-level editing tasks such as moving or adding furniture. In this paper, we present a novel neural scene rendering system, which learns an object-compositional neural radiance field and produces realistic rendering with editing capability for a clustered and real-world scene. Specifically, we design a novel two-pathway architecture, in which the scene branch encodes the scene geometry and appearance, and the object branch encodes each standalone object conditioned on learnable object activation codes. To survive the training in heavily cluttered scenes, we propose a scene-guided training strategy to solve the 3D space ambiguity in the occluded regions and learn sharp boundaries for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system not only achieves competitive performance for static scene novel-view synthesis, but also produces realistic rendering for object-level editing.

##### Unsupervised Layered Image Decomposition Into Object Prototypes

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Monnier_Unsupervised_Layered_Image_Decomposition_Into_Object_Prototypes_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We present an unsupervised learning framework for decomposing images into layers of automatically discovered object models. Contrary to recent approaches that model image layers with autoencoder networks, we represent them as explicit transformations of a small set of prototypical images. Our model has three main components: (i) a set of object prototypes in the form of learnable images with a transparency channel, which we refer to as sprites; (ii) differentiable parametric functions predicting occlusions and transformation parameters necessary to instantiate the sprites in a given image; (iii) a layered image formation model with occlusion for compositing these instances into complete images including background. By jointly learning the sprites and occlusion/transformation predictors to reconstruct images, our approach not only yields accurate layered image decompositions, but also identifies object categories and instance parameters. We first validate our approach by providing results on par with the state of the art on standard multi-object synthetic benchmarks (Tetrominoes, Multi-dSprites, CLEVR6). We then demonstrate the applicability of our model to real images in tasks that include clustering (SVHN, GTSRB), cosegmentation (Weizmann Horse) and object discovery from unfiltered social network images. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first layered image decomposition algorithm that learns an explicit and shared concept of object type, and is robust enough to be applied to real images.

-    The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies Transformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with two-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR suffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR from scratch needs 500 epochs to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct location-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA increases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention mechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged. Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3 mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to validate SMCA. Code is released at https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/SMCA-DETR.

-    In this work, we study the problem of human-object interaction (HOI) detection with large vocabulary object categories. Previous HOI studies are mainly conducted in the regime of limit object categories (e.g., 80 categories). Their solutions may face new difficulties in both object detection and interaction classification due to the increasing diversity of objects (e.g., 1000 categories). Different from previous methods, we formulate the HOI detection as a query problem. We propose a unified model to jointly discover the target objects and predict the corresponding interactions based on the human queries, thereby eliminating the need of using generic object detectors, extra steps to associate human-object instances, and multi-stream interaction recognition. This is achieved by a repurposed Transformer unit and a novel cascade detection over multi-scale feature maps. We observe that such a highly-coupled solution brings benefits for both object detection and interaction classification in a large vocabulary setting. To study the new challenges of the large vocabulary HOI detection, we assemble two datasets from the publicly available SWiG and 100 Days of Hands datasets. Experiments on these datasets validate that our proposed method can achieve a notable mAP improvement on HOI detection with a faster inference speed than existing one-stage HOI detectors.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Du_Learning_To_Better_Segment_Objects_From_Unseen_Classes_With_Unlabeled_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    The ability to localize and segment objects from unseen classes would open the door to new applications, such as autonomous object learning in active vision. Nonetheless, improving the performance on unseen classes requires additional training data, while manually annotating the objects of the unseen classes can be labor-extensive and expensive. In this paper, we explore the use of unlabeled video sequences to automatically generate training data for objects of unseen classes. It is in principle possible to apply existing video segmentation methods to unlabeled videos and automatically obtain object masks, which can then be used as a training set even for classes with no manual labels available. However, our experiments show that these methods do not perform well enough for this purpose. We therefore introduce a Bayesian method that is specifically designed to automatically create such a training set: Our method starts from a set of object proposals and relies on (non-realistic) analysis-by-synthesis to select the correct ones by performing an efficient optimization over all the frames simultaneously. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can generate a high-quality training set which significantly boosts the performance of segmenting objects of unseen classes. We thus believe that our method could open the door for open-world instance segmentation by exploiting abundant Internet videos.

-    This paper presents a new task, point cloud object co-segmentation, aiming to segment the common 3D objects in a set of point clouds. We formulate this task as an object point sampling problem, and develop two techniques, the mutual attention module and co-contrastive learning, to enable it. The proposed method employs two point samplers based on deep neural networks, the object sampler and the background sampler. The former targets at sampling points of common objects while the latter focuses on the rest. The mutual attention module explores point-wise correlation across point clouds. It is embedded in both samplers and can identify points with strong cross-cloud correlation from the rest. After extracting features for points selected by the two samplers, we optimize the networks by developing the co-contrastive loss, which minimizes feature discrepancy of the estimated object points while maximizing feature separation between the estimated object and background points. Our method works on point clouds of an arbitrary object class. It is end-to-end trainable and does not need point-level annotations. It is evaluated on the ScanObjectNN and S3DIS datasets and achieves promising results.

-    Salient object detection identifies objects in an image that grab visual attention. Although contextual features are considered in recent literature, they often fail in real-world complex scenarios. We observe that this is mainly due to two issues: First, most existing datasets consist of simple foregrounds and backgrounds that hardly represent real-life scenarios. Second, current methods only learn contextual features of salient objects, which are insufficient to model high-level semantics for saliency reasoning in complex scenes. To address these problems, we first construct a new large-scale dataset with complex scenes in this paper. We then propose a context-aware learning approach to explicitly exploit the semantic scene contexts. Specifically, two modules are proposed to achieve the goal: 1) a Semantic Scene Context Refinement module to enhance contextual features learned from salient objects with scene context, and 2) a Contextual Instance Transformer to learn contextual relations between objects and scene context. To our knowledge, such high-level semantic contextual information of image scenes is under-explored for saliency detection in the literature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in complex scenarios for saliency detection, and transfers well to other existing datasets.

-    We present a comprehensive framework for egocentric interaction recognition using markerless 3D annotations of two hands manipulating objects. To this end, we propose a method to create a unified dataset for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. Our method produces annotations of the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, along with their interaction labels for each frame. Our dataset, called H2O (2 Hands and Objects), provides synchronized multi-view RGB-D images, interaction labels, object classes, ground-truth 3D poses for left & right hands, 6D object poses, ground-truth camera poses, object meshes and scene point clouds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that enables the study of first-person actions with the use of the pose of both left and right hands manipulating objects and presents an unprecedented level of detail for egocentric 3D interaction recognition. We further propose the method to predict interaction classes by estimating the 3D pose of two hands and the 6D pose of the manipulated objects, jointly from RGB images. Our method models both inter- and intra-dependencies between both hands and objects by learning the topology of a graph convolutional network that predicts interactions. We show that our method facilitated by this dataset establishes a strong baseline for joint hand-object pose estimation and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for first person interaction recognition.

-    Feature pyramids have been proven powerful in image understanding tasks that require multi-scale features. Stateof-the-art methods for multi-scale feature learning focus on performing feature interactions across space and scales using neural networks with a fixed topology. In this paper, we propose graph feature pyramid networks that are capable of adapting their topological structures to varying intrinsic image structures, and supporting simultaneous feature interactions across all scales. We first define an image specific superpixel hierarchy for each input image to represent its intrinsic image structures. The graph feature pyramid network inherits its structure from this superpixel hierarchy. Contextual and hierarchical layers are designed to achieve feature interactions within the same scale and across different scales, respectively. To make these layers more powerful, we introduce two types of local channel attention for graph neural networks by generalizing global channel attention for convolutional neural networks. The proposed graph feature pyramid network can enhance the multiscale features from a convolutional feature pyramid network. We evaluate our graph feature pyramid network in the object detection task by integrating it into the Faster RCNN algorithm. The modified algorithm not only outperforms previous state-of-the-art feature pyramid based methods with a clear margin but also outperforms other popular detection methods on both MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets.

-    For semantic segmentation, label probabilities are often uncalibrated as they are typically only the by-product of a segmentation task. Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice score are often used as criteria for segmentation success, while metrics related to label probabilities are not often explored. However, probability calibration approaches have been studied, which match probability outputs with experimentally observed errors. These approaches mainly focus on classification tasks, but not on semantic segmentation. Thus, we propose a learning-based calibration method that focuses on multi-label semantic segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a convolutional neural network to predict local temperature values for probability calibration. One advantage of our approach is that it does not change prediction accuracy, hence allowing for calibration as a post-processing step. Experiments on the COCO, CamVid, and LPBA40 datasets demonstrate improved calibration performance for a range of different metrics.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jang_CodeNeRF_Disentangled_Neural_Radiance_Fields_for_Object_Categories_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    CodeNeRF is an implicit 3D neural representation that learns the variation of object shapes and textures across a category and can be trained, from a set of posed images, to synthesize novel views of unseen objects. Unlike the original NeRF, which is scene specific, CodeNeRF learns to disentangle shape and texture by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test time. Our results on real-world images demonstrate that CodeNeRF can bridge the sim-to-real gap. Project page: https://github.com/wayne1123/code-nerf

##### Generic Attention-Model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and Encoder-Decoder Transformers

-    Transformers are increasingly dominating multi-modal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results thanks to their ability to contextualize information using the self-attention and co-attention mechanisms. These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision tasks including object detection and image segmentation. Unlike Transformers that only use self-attention, Transformers with co-attention require to consider multiple attention maps in parallel in order to highlight the information that is relevant to the prediction in the model's input. In this work, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any Transformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these to the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure self-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii) encoder-decoder attention. We show that our method is superior to all existing methods which are adapted from single modality explainability.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_Continuous_Copy-Paste_for_One-Stage_Multi-Object_Tracking_and_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Current one-step multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) methods lag behind recent two-step methods. By separating the instance segmentation stage from the tracking stage, two-step methods can exploit non-video datasets as extra data for training instance segmentation. Moreover, instances belonging to different IDs on different frames, rather than limited numbers of instances in raw consecutive frames, can be gathered to allow more effective hard example mining in the training of trackers. In this paper, we bridge this gap by presenting a novel data augmentation strategy named continuous copy-paste (CCP). Our intuition behind CCP is to fully exploit the pixel-wise annotations provided by MOTS to actively increase the number of instances as well as unique instance IDs in training. Without any modifications to frameworks, current MOTS methods achieve significant performance gains when trained with CCP. Based on CCP, we propose the first effective one-stage online MOTS method named CCPNet, which generates instance masks as well as the tracking results in one shot. Our CCPNet surpasses all state-of-the-art methods by large margins (3.8% higher sMOTSA and 4.1% higher MOTSA for pedestrians on the KITTI MOTS Validation) and ranks 1st on the KITTI MOTS leaderboard. Evaluations across three datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of both CCP and CCPNet. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/detectRecog/CCP.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jiang_Hand-Object_Contact_Consistency_Reasoning_for_Human_Grasps_Generation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    While predicting robot grasps with parallel jaw grippers have been well studied and widely applied in robot manipulation tasks, the study on natural human grasp generation with a multi-finger hand remains a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to generate human grasps given a 3D object in the world. Our key observation is that it is crucial to model the consistency between the hand contact points and object contact regions. That is, we encourage the prior hand contact points to be close to the object surface and the object common contact regions to be touched by the hand at the same time. Based on the hand-object contact consistency, we design novel objectives in training the human grasp generation model and also a new self-supervised task which allows the grasp generation network to be adjusted even during test time. Our experiments show significant improvement in human grasp generation over state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. More interestingly, by optimizing the model during test time with the self-supervised task, it helps achieve larger gain on unseen and out-of-domain objects.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Reconcile_Prediction_Consistency_for_Balanced_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Classification and regression are two pillars of object detectors. In most CNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without direct interactions between them, the classification loss and the regression loss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal direction in the training phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with high classification score but low localization accuracy or low classification score but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the objects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection performance of existing detectors after NMS. To reconcile prediction consistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to harmonize the optimization of classification branch and localization branch. The Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each other during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high co-occurrence of top classification and localization in the inference phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominated by outliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize the weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our model for facilitating existing object detectors to state-of-the-art accuracy.

-    3D point cloud understanding has made great progress in recent years. However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets, especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task. Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on several base models, especially when less training data are used, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D. We expect our attempt to provide a new perspective for bridging object and scene-level 3D understanding.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Peng_Conformer_Local_Features_Coupling_Global_Representations_for_Visual_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Within Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the convolution operations are good at extracting local features but experience difficulty to capture global representations. Within visual transformer, the cascaded self-attention modules can capture long-distance feature dependencies but unfortunately deteriorate local feature details. In this paper, we propose a hybrid network structure, termed Conformer, to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for enhanced representation learning. Conformer roots in the Feature Coupling Unit (FCU), which fuses local features and global representations under different resolutions in an interactive fashion. Conformer adopts a concurrent structure so that local features and global representations are retained to the maximum extent. Experiments show that Conformer, under the comparable parameter complexity, outperforms the visual transformer (DeiT-B) by 2.3% on ImageNet. On MSCOCO, it outperforms ResNet-101 by 3.7% and 3.6% mAPs for object detection and instance segmentation, respectively, demonstrating the great potential to be a general backbone network.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Gu_PIT_Position-Invariant_Transform_for_Cross-FoV_Domain_Adaptation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Cross-domain object detection and semantic segmentation have witnessed impressive progress recently. Existing approaches mainly consider the domain shift resulting from external environments including the changes of background, illumination or weather, while distinct camera intrinsic parameters appear commonly in different domains and their influence for domain adaptation has been very rarely explored. In this paper, we observe that the Field of View (FoV) gap induces noticeable instance appearance differences between the source and target domains. We further discover that the FoV gap between two domains impairs domain adaptation performance under both the FoV-increasing (source FoV < target FoV) and FoV-decreasing cases. Motivated by the observations, we propose the Position-Invariant Transform (PIT) to better align images in different domains. We also introduce a reverse PIT for mapping the transformed/aligned images back to the original image space, and design a loss re-weighting strategy to accelerate the training process. Our method can be easily plugged into existing cross-domain detection/segmentation frameworks, while bringing about negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can soundly boost the performance on both cross-domain object detection and segmentation for state-of-the-art techniques.

##### Human Pose Regression With Residual Log-Likelihood Estimation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Li_Human_Pose_Regression_With_Residual_Log-Likelihood_Estimation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Heatmap-based methods dominate in the field of human pose estimation by modelling the output distribution through likelihood heatmaps. In contrast, regression-based methods are more efficient but suffer from inferior performance. In this work, we explore maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to develop an efficient and effective regression-based method. From the perspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different assumptions about the output density function. A density function closer to the true distribution leads to a better regression performance. In light of this, we propose a novel regression paradigm with Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE) to capture the underlying output distribution. Concretely, RLE learns the change of the distribution instead of the unreferenced underlying distribution to facilitate the training process. With the proposed reparameterization design, our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models. The proposed method is effective, efficient and flexible. We show its potential in various human pose estimation tasks with comprehensive experiments. Compared to the conventional regression paradigm, regression with RLE bring 12.4 mAP improvement on MSCOCO without any test-time overhead. Moreover, for the first time, especially on multi-person pose estimation, our regression method is superior to the heatmap-based methods.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xiao_Holistic_Pose_Graph_Modeling_Geometric_Structure_Among_Objects_in_a_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Due to the missing depth cues, it is essentially ambiguous to detect 3D objects from a single RGB image. Existing methods predict the 3D pose for each object independently or merely by combining local relationships within limited surroundings, but rarely explore the inherent geometric relationships from a global perspective. To address this issue, we argue that modeling geometric structure among objects in a scene is very crucial, and thus elaborately devise the Holistic Pose Graph (HPG) that explicitly integrates all geometric poses including the object pose treated as nodes and the relative pose treated as edges. The inference of the HPG uses GRU to encode the pose features from their corresponding regions in a single RGB image, and passes messages along the graph structure iteratively to improve the predicted poses. To further enhance the correspondence between the object pose and the relative pose, we propose a novel consistency loss to explicitly measure the deviations between them. Finally, we apply Holistic Pose Estimation (HPE) to jointly evaluate both the independent object pose and the relative pose. Our experiments on the SUN RGB-D dataset demonstrate that the proposed method provides a significant improvement on 3D object prediction.

##### DeFRCN: Decoupled Faster R-CNN for Few-Shot Object Detection

-    Few-shot object detection, which aims at detecting novel objects rapidly from extremely few annotated examples of previously unseen classes, has attracted significant research interest in the community. Most existing approaches employ the Faster R-CNN as basic detection framework, yet, due to the lack of tailored considerations for data-scarce scenario, their performance is often not satisfactory. In this paper, we look closely into the conventional Faster R-CNN and analyze its contradictions from two orthogonal perspectives, namely multi-stage (RPN vs. RCNN) and multi-task (classification vs. localization). To resolve these issues, we propose a simple yet effective architecture, named Decoupled Faster R-CNN (DeFRCN). To be concrete, we extend Faster R-CNN by introducing Gradient Decoupled Layer for multi-stage decoupling and Prototypical Calibration Block for multi-task decoupling. The former is a novel deep layer with redefining the feature-forward operation and gradient-backward operation for decoupling its subsequent layer and preceding layer, and the latter is an offline prototype-based classification model with taking the proposals from detector as input and boosting the original classification scores with additional pairwise scores for calibration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show our framework is remarkably superior to other existing approaches and establishes a new state-of-the-art in few-shot literature.

##### Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack: A Query-Based Black-Box Attack Against Object Detection

-    Object detection has been widely used in many safety-critical tasks, such as autonomous driving. However, its vulnerability to adversarial examples has not been sufficiently studied, especially under the practical scenario of black-box attacks, where the attacker can only access the query feedback of predicted bounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near the attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading to very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. Specifically, we generate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection near the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial perturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under white-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to improve the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of attacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and efficiently attack various popular object detectors, including anchor-based and anchor-free, and generate transferable adversarial examples.

-    Modeling the hand-object (HO) interaction not only requires estimation of the HO pose, but also pays attention to the contact due to their interaction. Significant progress has been made in estimating hand and object separately with deep learning methods, simultaneous HO pose estimation and contact modeling has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present an explicit contact representation namely Contact Potential Field (CPF), and a learning-fitting hybrid framework namely MIHO to Modeling the Interaction of Hand and Object. In CPF, we treat each contacting HO vertex pair as a spring-mass system. Hence the whole system forms a potential field with minimal elastic energy at the grasp position. Extensive experiments on the two commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art in several reconstruction metrics, and allow us to produce more physically plausible HO pose even when the ground-truth exhibits severe interpenetration or disjointedness.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhao_Self-Supervised_Visual_Representations_Learning_by_Contrastive_Mask_Prediction_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Advanced self-supervised visual representation learning methods rely on the instance discrimination (ID) pretext task. We point out that the ID task has an implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in unconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask prediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask contrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible to identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction head in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP. We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its performance with MoCo V2. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable performance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual Captions are used for training. MaskCo provides a promising alternative to the ID-based methods for self-supervised learning in the wild.

-    LiDAR point clouds collected from a moving vehicle are functions of its trajectories, because the sensor motion needs to be compensated to avoid distortions. When autonomous vehicles are sending LiDAR point clouds to deep networks for perception and planning, could the motion compensation consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car's trajectory with small perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack. Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not only lower the performance of the state-of-the-art detectors effectively, but also transfer to other detectors, raising a red flag for the community.

-    The ability to capture inter-frame dynamics has been critical to the development of video salient object detection (VSOD). While many works have achieved great success in this field, a deeper insight into its dynamic nature should be developed. In this work, we aim to answer the following questions: How can a model adjust itself to dynamic variations as well as perceive fine differences in the real-world environment; How are the temporal dynamics well introduced into spatial information over time? To this end, we propose a dynamic context-sensitive filtering network (DCFNet) equipped with a dynamic context-sensitive filtering module (DCFM) and an effective bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy. The proposed DCFM sheds new light on dynamic filter generation by extracting location-related affinities between consecutive frames. Our bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy encourages the interaction of spatial and temporal information in a dynamic manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on most VSOD datasets while ensuring a real-time speed of 28 fps.

-    We present a large-scale stereo RGB image object pose estimation dataset named the StereOBJ-1M dataset. The dataset is designed to address challenging cases such as object transparency, translucency, and specular reflection, in addition to the common challenges of occlusion, symmetry, and variations in illumination and environments. In order to collect data of sufficient scale for modern deep learning models, we propose a novel method for efficiently annotating pose data in a multi-view fashion that allows data capturing in complex and flexible environments. Fully annotated with 6D object poses, our dataset contains over 396K frames and over 1.5M annotations of 18 objects recorded in 183 scenes constructed in 11 different environments. The 18 objects include 8 symmetric objects, 7 transparent objects, and 8 reflective objects. We benchmark two state-of-the-art pose estimation frameworks on StereOBJ-1M as baselines for future work. We also propose a novel object-level pose optimization method for computing 6D pose from keypoint predictions in multiple images.

-    There exists many powerful architectures for object detection and semantic segmentation of both biomedical and natural images. However, a difficulty arises in the ability to create training datasets that are large and well-varied. The importance of this subject is nested in the amount of training data that artificial neural networks need to accurately identify and segment objects in images and the infeasibility of acquiring a sufficient dataset within the biomedical field. This paper introduces a new data augmentation method that generates artificial cell nuclei microscopical images along with their correct semantic segmentation labels. Data augmentation provides a step toward accessing higher generalization capabilities of artificial neural networks. An initial set of segmentation objects is used with Greedy AutoAugment to find the strongest performing augmentation policies. The found policies and the initial set of segmentation objects are then used in the creation of the final artificial images. When comparing the state-of-the-art data augmentation methods with the proposed method, the proposed method is shown to consistently outperform current solutions in the generation of nuclei microscopical images.

-    Humans are able to continuously detect and track surrounding objects by constructing a spatial-temporal memory of the objects when looking around. In contrast, 3D object detectors in existing tracking-by-detection systems often search for objects in every new video frame from scratch, without fully leveraging memory from previous detection results. In this work, we propose a novel system for integrated 3D object detection and tracking, which uses a dynamic object occupancy map and previous object states as spatial-temporal memory to assist object detection in future frames. This memory, together with the ego-motion from back-end odometry, guides the detector to achieve more efficient object proposal generation and more accurate object state estimation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and its performance on the ScanNet and KITTI datasets. Moreover, the proposed system produces stable bounding boxes and pose trajectories over time, while being able to handle occluded and truncated objects.

-    We address the problem of scene layout generation for diverse domains such as images, mobile applications, documents, and 3D objects. Most complex scenes, natural or human-designed, can be expressed as a meaningful arrangement of simpler compositional graphical primitives. Generating a new layout or extending an existing layout requires understanding the relationships between these primitives. To do this, we propose LayoutTransformer, a novel framework that leverages self-attention to learn contextual relationships between layout elements and generate novel layouts in a given domain. Our framework allows us to generate a new layout either from an empty set or from an initial seed set of primitives, and can easily scale to support an arbitrary of primitives per layout. Furthermore, our analyses show that the model is able to automatically capture the semantic properties of the primitives. We propose simple improvements in both representation of layout primitives, as well as training methods to demonstrate competitive performance in very diverse data domains such as object bounding boxes in natural images (COCO bounding box), documents (PubLayNet), mobile applications (RICO dataset) as well as 3D shapes (Part-Net).

-    Current 3D object detection paradigms highly rely on extensive annotation efforts, which makes them not practical in many real-world industrial applications. Inspired by that a human driver can keep accumulating experiences from self-exploring the roads without any tutor's guidance, we first step forwards to explore a simple yet effective self-supervised learning framework tailored for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. Although the self-supervised pipeline has achieved great success in 2D domain, the characteristic challenges (e.g., complex geometry structure and various 3D object views) encountered in the 3D domain hinder the direct adoption of existing techniques that often contrast the 2D augmented data or cluster single-view features. Here we present a novel self-supervised 3D Object detection framework that seamlessly integrates the geometry-aware contrast and clustering harmonization to lift the unsupervised 3D representation learning, named GCC-3D. First, GCC-3D introduces a Geometric-Aware Contrastive objective to learn spatial-sensitive local structure representation. This objective enforces the spatially-closed voxels to have high feature similarity. Second, a Pseudo-Instance Clustering harmonization mechanism is proposed to encourage that different views of pseudo-instances should have consistent similarities to clustering prototype centers. This module endows our model semantic discriminative capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our GCC-3D achieves significant performance improvement on data-efficient 3D object detection benchmarks (nuScenes and Waymo). Moreover, our GCC-3D framework can achieve state-of-the art performances on all popular 3D object detection benchmarks.

-    Currently, the state-of-the-art methods treat few-shot semantic segmentation task as a conditional foreground-background segmentation problem, assuming each class is independent. In this paper, we introduce the concept of meta-class, which is the meta information (e.g. certain middle-level features) shareable among all classes. To explicitly learn meta-class representations in few-shot segmentation task, we propose a novel Meta-class Memory based few-shot segmentation method (MM-Net), where we introduce a set of learnable memory embeddings to memorize the meta-class information during the base class training and transfer to novel classes during the inference stage. Moreover, for the k-shot scenario, we propose a novel image quality measurement module to select images from the set of support images. A high-quality class prototype could be obtained with the weighted sum of support image features based on the quality measure. Experiments on both PASCAL-5^i and COCO datasets show that our proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-art results in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Particularly, our proposed MM-Net achieves 37.5% mIoU on the COCO dataset in 1-shot setting, which is 5.1% higher than the previous state-of-the-art.

-    Traditional approaches for learning 3D object categories have been predominantly trained and evaluated on synthetic datasets due to the unavailability of real 3D-annotated category-centric data. Our main goal is to facilitate advances in this field by collecting real-world data in a magnitude similar to the existing synthetic counterparts. The principal contribution of this work is thus a large-scale dataset, called Common Objects in 3D, with real multi-view images of object categories annotated with camera poses and ground truth 3D point clouds. The dataset contains a total of 1.5 million frames from nearly 19,000 videos capturing objects from 50 MS-COCO categories and, as such, it is significantly larger than alternatives both in terms of the number of categories and objects. We exploit this new dataset to conduct one of the first large-scale "in-the-wild" evaluations of several new-view-synthesis and category-centric 3D reconstruction methods. Finally, we contribute NerFormer - a novel neural rendering method that leverages the powerful Transformer to reconstruct an object given a small number of its views.

-    We study the problem of understanding hand-object interactions from 2D images in the wild. This requires reconstructing both the hand and the object in 3D, which is challenging because of the mutual occlusion between the hand and the object. In this paper we make two main contributions: (1) a novel reconstruction technique, RHO (Reconstructing Hands and Objects), which reconstructs 3D models of both the hand and the object leveraging the 2D image cues and 3D contact priors; (2) a dataset MOW (Manipulating Objects in the Wild) of 500 examples of hand-object interaction images that have been "3Dfied" with the help of the RHO technique. Overall our dataset contains 121 distinct object categories, with a much greater diversity of manipulation actions, than in previous datasets.

##### TOOD: Task-Aligned One-Stage Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Feng_TOOD_Task-Aligned_One-Stage_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    One-stage object detection is commonly implemented by optimizing two sub-tasks: object classification and localization, using heads with two parallel branches, which might lead to a certain level of spatial misalignment in predictions between the two tasks. In this work, we propose a Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) that explicitly aligns the two tasks in a learning-based manner. First, we design a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head) which offers a better balance between learning task-interactive and task-specific features, as well as a greater flexibility to learn the alignment via a task-aligned predictor. Second, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly pull closer (or even unify) the optimal anchors for the two tasks during training via a designed sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on MS-COCO, where TOOD achieves a 51.1 AP at single-model single-scale testing. This surpasses the recent one-stage detectors by a large margin, such as ATSS (47.7 AP), GFL (48.2 AP), and PAA (49.0 AP), with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Qualitative results also demonstrate the effectiveness of TOOD for better aligning the tasks of object classification and localization. Code is available at https://github.com/fcjian/TOOD.

##### Parallel Detection-and-Segmentation Learning for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Shen_Parallel_Detection-and-Segmentation_Learning_for_Weakly_Supervised_Instance_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) with only image-level labels has recently drawn much attention. To date, bottom-up WSIS methods refine discriminative cues from classifiers with sophisticated multi-stage training procedures, which also suffer from inconsistent object boundaries. And top-down WSIS methods are formulated as cascade detection-to-segmentation pipeline, in which the quality of segmentation learning heavily depends on pseudo masks generated from detectors. In this paper, we propose a unified parallel detection-and-segmentation learning (PDSL) framework to learn instance segmentation with only image-level labels, which draws inspiration from both top-down and bottom-up instance segmentation approaches. The detection module is the same as the typical design of any weakly supervised object detection, while the segmentation module leverages self-supervised learning to model class-agnostic foreground extraction, following by self-training to refine class-specific segmentation. We further design instance-activation correlation module to improve the coherence between detection and segmentation branches. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed method outperforms baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

##### Real-Time Instance Segmentation With Discriminative Orientation Maps

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Du_Real-Time_Instance_Segmentation_With_Discriminative_Orientation_Maps_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Although instance segmentation has made considerable advancement over recent years, it's still a challenge to design high accuracy algorithms with real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time instance segmentation framework termed OrienMask. Upon the one-stage object detector YOLOv3, a mask head is added to predict some discriminative orientation maps, which are explicitly defined as spatial offset vectors for both foreground and background pixels. Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be recovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances that match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This special sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask predictions but without loss of mask granularity. Given the surviving box predictions after NMS, instance masks can be concurrently constructed from the corresponding orientation maps with low complexity. Owing to the concise design for mask representation and its effective integration with the anchor-based object detector, our method is qualified under real-time conditions while maintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on COCO benchmark show that OrienMask achieves 34.8 mask AP at the speed of 42.7 fps evaluated with a single RTX 2080 Ti. Code is available at github.com/duwt/OrienMask.

-    We recover high-frequency information encoded in the shadows cast by an object to estimate a hemispherical photograph from the viewpoint of the object, effectively turning objects into cameras. Estimating environment maps is useful for advanced image editing tasks such as relighting, object insertion or removal, and material parameter estimation. Because the problem is ill-posed, recent works in illumination recovery have tackled the problem of low-frequency lighting for object insertion, rely upon specular surface materials, or make use of data-driven methods that are susceptible to hallucination without physically plausible constraints. We incorporate an optimization scheme to update scene parameters that could enable practical capture of real-world scenes. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for evaluating expected recovery performance for different types and shapes of objects.

##### PyMAF: 3D Human Pose and Shape Regression With Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback Loop

-    Regression-based methods have recently shown promising results in reconstructing human meshes from monocular images. By directly mapping raw pixels to model parameters, these methods can produce parametric models in a feed-forward manner via neural networks. However, minor deviation in parameters may lead to noticeable misalignment between the estimated meshes and image evidences. To address this issue, we propose a Pyramidal Mesh Alignment Feedback (PyMAF) loop to leverage a feature pyramid and rectify the predicted parameters explicitly based on the mesh-image alignment status in our deep regressor. In PyMAF, given the currently predicted parameters, mesh-aligned evidences will be extracted from finer-resolution features accordingly and fed back for parameter rectification. To reduce noise and enhance the reliability of these evidences, an auxiliary pixel-wise supervision is imposed on the feature encoder, which provides mesh-image correspondence guidance for our network to preserve the most related information in spatial features. The efficacy of our approach is validated on several benchmarks, including Human3.6M, 3DPW, LSP, and COCO, where experimental results show that our approach consistently improves the mesh-image alignment of the reconstruction.

##### COOKIE: Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-Training for Vision-Language Representation

-    There has been a recent surge of interest in cross-modal pre-training. However, existed approaches pre-train a one-stream model to learn joint vision-language representation, which suffers from calculation explosion when conducting cross-modal retrieval. In this work, we propose the Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training (COOKIE) method to learn universal text-image representations. There are two key designs in it, one is the weight-sharing transformer on top of the visual and textual encoders to align text and image semantically, the other is three kinds of contrastive learning designed for sharing knowledge between different modalities. Cross-modal knowledge sharing greatly promotes the learning of unimodal representation. Experiments on multi-modal matching tasks including cross-modal retrieval, text matching, and image retrieval show the effectiveness and efficiency of our pre-training framework. Our COOKIE fine-tuned on cross-modal datasets MSCOCO, Flickr30K, and MSRVTT achieves new state-of-the-art results while using only 3/1000 inference time comparing to one-stream models. There are also 5.7 and 3.9 improvements in the task of image retrieval and text matching. Source code will be made public.

-    Recovering the 3D structure of an object from a single image is a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. One approach is to utilize the plentiful photos of the same object category to learn a strong 3D shape prior for the object. This approach has successfully been demonstrated by a recent work of Wu et al. (2020), which obtained impressive 3D reconstruction networks with unsupervised learning. However, their algorithm is only applicable to symmetric objects. In this paper, we eliminate the symmetry requirement with a novel unsupervised algorithm that can learn a 3D reconstruction network from a multi-image dataset. Our algorithm is more general and covers the symmetry-required scenario as a special case. Besides, we employ a novel albedo loss that improves the reconstructed details and realisticity. Our method surpasses the previous work in both quality and robustness, as shown in experiments on datasets of various structures, including single-view, multi-view, image-collection, and video sets.

##### Learning To Track With Object Permanence

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Tokmakov_Learning_To_Track_With_Object_Permanence_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Tracking by detection, the dominant approach for online multi-object tracking, alternates between localization and association steps. As a result, it strongly depends on the quality of instantaneous observations, often failing when objects are not fully visible. In contrast, tracking in humans is underlined by the notion of object permanence: once an object is recognized, we are aware of its physical existence and can approximately localize it even under full occlusions. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end trainable approach for joint object detection and tracking that is capable of such reasoning. We build on top of the recent CenterTrack architecture, which takes pairs of frames as input, and extend it to videos of arbitrary length. To this end, we augment the model with a spatio-temporal, recurrent memory module, allowing it to reason about object locations and identities in the current frame using all the previous history. It is, however, not obvious how to train such an approach. We study this question on a new, large-scale, synthetic dataset for multi-object tracking, which provides ground truth annotations for invisible objects, and propose several approaches for supervising tracking behind occlusions. Our model, trained jointly on synthetic and real data, outperforms the state of the art on KITTI and MOT17 datasets thanks to its robustness to occlusions.

##### Uncertainty-Guided Transformer Reasoning for Camouflaged Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yang_Uncertainty-Guided_Transformer_Reasoning_for_Camouflaged_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    Spotting objects that are visually adapted to their surroundings is challenging for both humans and AI. Conventional generic / salient object detection techniques are suboptimal for this task because they tend to only discover easy and clear objects, while overlooking the difficult-to-detect ones with inherent uncertainties derived from indistinguishable textures. In this work, we contribute a novel approach using a probabilistic representational model in combination with transformers to explicitly reason under uncertainties, namely uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning (UGTR), for camouflaged object detection. The core idea is to first learn a conditional distribution over the backbone's output to obtain initial estimates and associated uncertainties, and then reason over these uncertain regions with attention mechanism to produce final predictions. Our approach combines the benefits of both Bayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning, allowing the model to handle camouflaged object detection by leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic information. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art models on CHAMELEON, CAMO and COD10K datasets.

##### TransPose: Keypoint Localization via Transformer

-    While CNN-based models have made remarkable progress on human pose estimation, what spatial dependencies they capture to localize keypoints remains unclear. In this work, we propose a model called TransPose, which introduces Transformer for human pose estimation. The attention layers built in Transformer enable our model to capture long-range relationships efficiently and also can reveal what dependencies the predicted keypoints rely on. To predict keypoint heatmaps, the last attention layer acts as an aggregator, which collects contributions from image clues and forms maximum positions of keypoints. Such a heatmap-based localization approach via Transformer conforms to the principle of Activation Maximization. And the revealed dependencies are image-specific and fine-grained, which also can provide evidence of how the model handles special cases, e.g., occlusion. The experiments show that TransPose achieves 75.8 AP and 75.0 AP on COCO validation and test-dev sets, while being more lightweight and faster than mainstream CNN architectures. The TransPose model also transfers very well on MPII benchmark, achieving superior performance on the test set when fine-tuned with small training costs. Code and pre-trained models are publicly available.

##### Vector-Decomposed Disentanglement for Domain-Invariant Object Detection

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wu_Vector-Decomposed_Disentanglement_for_Domain-Invariant_Object_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    To improve the generalization of detectors, for domain adaptive object detection (DAOD), recent advances mainly explore aligning feature-level distributions between the source and single-target domain, which may neglect the impact of domain-specific information existing in the aligned features. Towards DAOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant object representations. To this end, in this paper, we try to disentangle domain-invariant representations from domain-specific representations. And we propose a novel disentangled method based on vector decomposition. Firstly, an extractor is devised to separate domain-invariant representations from the input, which are used for extracting object proposals. Secondly, domain-specific representations are introduced as the differences between the input and domain-invariant representations. Through the difference operation, the gap between the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations is enlarged, which promotes domain-invariant representations to contain more domain-irrelevant information. In the experiment, we separately evaluate our method on the single- and compound-target case. For the single-target case, experimental results of four domain-shift scenes show our method obtains a significant performance gain over baseline methods. Moreover, for the compound-target case (i.e., the target is a compound of two different domains without domain labels), our method outperforms baseline methods by around 4%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

-    Conventional video inpainting is neither object-oriented nor occlusion-aware, making it liable to obvious artifacts when large occluded object regions are inpainted. This paper presents occlusion-aware video object inpainting, which recovers both the complete shape and appearance for occluded objects in videos given their visible mask segmentation. To facilitate this new research, we construct the first large-scale video object inpainting benchmark YouTube-VOI  to provide realistic occlusion scenarios with both occluded and visible object masks available. Our technical contribution VOIN jointly performs video object shape completion and occluded texture generation. In particular, the shape completion module models long-range object coherence while the flow completion module recovers accurate flow with sharp motion boundary, for propagating temporally-consistent texture to the same moving object across frames. For more realistic results, VOIN is optimized using both T-PatchGAN and a new spatio-temporal attention-based multi-class discriminator. Finally, we compare VOIN and strong baselines on YouTube-VOI. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our method including inpainting complex and dynamic objects. VOIN degrades gracefully with inaccurate input visible mask.

-    Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes given only a few annotated samples. Existing methods suffer the problem of feature undermining, i.e. potential novel classes are treated as background during training phase. Our method aims to alleviate this problem and enhance the feature embedding on latent novel classes. In our work, we propose a novel joint-training framework. Based on conventional episodic training on support-query pairs, we add an additional mining branch that exploits latent novel classes via transferable sub-clusters, and a new rectification technique on both background and foreground categories to enforce more stable prototypes. Over and above that, our transferable sub-cluster has the ability to leverage extra unlabeled data for further feature enhancement. Extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of 3.7% mIOU on PASCAL-5i and 7.0% mIOU on COCO-20i at the cost of 74% fewer parameters and 2.5x faster inference speed.

-    Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by selecting only the most informative samples on a dataset. Few existing works have addressed active learning for object detection. Most of these methods are based on multiple models or are straightforward extensions of classification methods, hence estimate an image's informativeness using only the classification head. In this paper, we propose a novel deep active learning approach for object detection. Our approach relies on mixture density networks that estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classification head's output. We explicitly estimate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass of a single model. Our method uses a scoring function that aggregates these two types of uncertainties for both heads to obtain every image's informativeness score. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms single-model based methods and performs on par with multi-model based methods at a fraction of the computing cost.

-    CNNs perform remarkably well when the training and test distributions are i.i.d, but unseen image corruptions can cause a surprisingly large drop in performance. In various real scenarios, unexpected distortions, such as random noise, compression artefacts, or weather distortions are common phenomena. Improving performance on corrupted images must not result in degraded i.i.d performance - a challenge faced by many state-of-the-art robust approaches. Image corruption types have different characteristics in the frequency spectrum and would benefit from a targeted type of data augmentation, which, however, is often unknown during training. In this paper, we introduce a mixture of two expert models specializing in high and low-frequency robustness, respectively. Moreover, we propose a new regularization scheme that minimizes the total variation (TV) of convolution feature-maps to increase high-frequency robustness. The approach improves on corrupted images without degrading in-distribution performance. We demonstrate this on ImageNet-C and also for real-world corruptions on an automotive dataset, both for object classification and object detection.

-    With recent developments of convolutional neural networks, deep learning for 3D point clouds has shown significant progress in various 3D scene understanding tasks, e.g., object recognition, object detection. In a safety-critical environment, it is however not well understood how such deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this work, we explore adversarial attacks for point cloud-based neural networks. We propose a new formulation for adversarial point cloud generation that can generalise two different attack strategies. Our method generates adversarial examples by attacking the classification ability of point cloud-based networks while considering the perceptibility of the examples and ensuring the minimal level of point manipulations. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with higher than 89% and 90% of attack success rate on synthetic and real-world data respectively, while manipulating only about 4% of the total points.

-    By estimating 3D shape and instances from a single view, we can capture information about the environment quickly, without the need for comprehensive scanning and multi-view fusion. Solving this task for composite scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a center voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space. We argue that this method has practical applications in providing robots some of the ability humans have to make rapid intuitive inferences of partially observed scenes. We demonstrate an application for precise (non-disruptive) object grasping of unknown objects from a single depth view.

-    Vision systems that deploy Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Recent research has shown that checking the intrinsic consistencies in the input data is a promising way to detect adversarial attacks (e.g., by checking the object co-occurrence relationships in complex scenes). However, existing approaches are tied to specific models and do not offer generalizability. Motivated by the observation that language descriptions of natural scene images have already captured the object co-occurrence relationships that can be learned by a language model, we develop a novel approach to perform context consistency checks using such language models. The distinguishing aspect of our approach is that it is independent of the deployed object detector and yet offers very high accuracy in terms of detecting adversarial examples in practical scenes with multiple objects. Experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that our method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversarial attacks.

-    We present a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation method which jointly achieves two desiderata of segmentation model regularities: the label-space consistency property between image augmentations and the feature-space contrastive property among different pixels. We leverage the pixel-level L2 loss and the pixel contrastive loss for the two purposes respectively. To address the computational efficiency issue and the false negative noise issue involved in the pixel contrastive loss, we further introduce and investigate several negative sampling techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method (PC2Seg) with the DeepLab-v3+ architecture, in several challenging semi-supervised settings derived from the VOC, Cityscapes, and COCO datasets.

-    Image captioning is an important task for benchmarking visual reasoning and for enabling accessibility for people with vision impairments. However, as in many machine learning settings, social biases can influence image captioning in undesirable ways. In this work, we study bias propagation pathways within image captioning, focusing specifically on the COCO dataset. Prior work has analyzed gender bias in captions using automatically-derived gender labels; here we examine racial and intersectional biases using manual annotations. Our first contribution is in annotating the perceived gender and skin color of 28,315 of the depicted people after obtaining IRB approval. Using these annotations, we compare racial biases present in both manual and automatically-generated image captions. We demonstrate differences in caption performance, sentiment, and word choice between images of lighter versus darker-skinned people. Further, we find the magnitude of these differences to be greater in modern captioning systems compared to older ones, thus leading to concerns that without proper consideration and mitigation these differences will only become increasingly prevalent.

-    This paper proposes Panoptic Narrative Grounding, a spatially fine and general formulation of the natural language visual grounding problem. We establish an experimental framework for the study of this new task, including new ground truth and metrics, and we propose a strong baseline method to serve as stepping stone for future work. We exploit the intrinsic semantic richness in an image by including panoptic categories, and we approach visual grounding at a fine-grained level by using segmentations. In terms of ground truth, we propose an algorithm to automatically transfer Localized Narratives annotations to specific regions in the panoptic segmentations of the MS COCO dataset. To guarantee the quality of our annotations, we take advantage of the semantic structure contained in WordNet to exclusively incorporate noun phrases that are grounded to a meaningfully related panoptic segmentation region. The proposed baseline achieves a performance of 55.4 absolute Average Recall points. This result is a suitable foundation to push the envelope further in the development of methods for Panoptic Narrative Grounding.

-    Existing deep learning-based approaches for monocular 3D object detection in autonomous driving often model the object as a rotated 3D cuboid while the object's geometric shape has been ignored. In this work, we propose an approach for incorporating the shape-aware 2D/3D constraints into the 3D detection framework. Specifically, we employ the deep neural network to learn distinguished 2D keypoints in the 2D image domain and regress their corresponding 3D coordinates in the local 3D object coordinate first. Then the 2D/3D geometric constraints are built by these correspondences for each object to boost the detection performance. For generating the ground truth of 2D/3D keypoints, an automatic model-fitting approach has been proposed by fitting the deformed 3D object model and the object mask in the 2D image. The proposed framework has been verified on the public KITTI dataset and the experimental results demonstrate that by using additional geometrical constraints the detection performance has been significantly improved as compared to the baseline method. More importantly, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with real time. Data and code will be available at https://github.com/zongdai/AutoShape

-    Understanding the scene around the ego-vehicle is key to assisted and autonomous driving. Nowadays, this is mostly conducted using cameras and laser scanners, despite their reduced performances in adverse weather conditions. Automotive radars are low-cost active sensors that measure properties of surrounding objects, including their relative speed, and have the key advantage of not being impacted by rain, snow or fog. However, they are seldom used for scene understanding due to the size and complexity of radar raw data and the lack of annotated datasets. Fortunately, recent open-sourced datasets have opened up research on classification, object detection and semantic segmentation with raw radar signals using end-to-end trainable models. In this work, we propose several novel architectures, and their associated losses, which analyse multiple "views" of the range-angle-Doppler radar tensor to segment it semantically. Experiments conducted on the recent CARRADA dataset demonstrate that our best model outperforms alternative models, derived either from the semantic segmentation of natural images or from radar scene understanding, while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Both our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/valeoai/MVRSS.

-    Human pose estimation deeply relies on visual clues and anatomical constraints between parts to locate keypoints. Most existing CNN-based methods do well in visual representation, however, lacking in the ability to explicitly learn the constraint relationships between keypoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Token representation for human Pose estimation (TokenPose). In detail, each keypoint is explicitly embedded as a token to simultaneously learn constraint relationships and appearance cues from images. Extensive experiments show that the small and large TokenPose models are on par with state-of-the-art CNN-based counterparts while being more lightweight. Specifically, our TokenPose-S and TokenPose-L achieve 72.5 AP and 75.8 AP on COCO validation dataset respectively, with significant reduction in parameters and GFLOPs. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/leeyegy/TokenPose.

-    We study the problem of multi-label zero-shot recognition in which labels are in the form of human-object interactions (combinations of actions on objects), each image may contain multiple interactions and some interactions do not have training images. We propose a novel compositional learning framework that decouples interaction labels into separate action and object scores that incorporate the spatial compatibility between the two components. We combine these scores to efficiently recognize seen and unseen interactions. However, learning action-object spatial relations, in principle, requires bounding-box annotations, which are costly to gather. Moreover, it is not clear how to generalize spatial relations to unseen interactions. We address these challenges by developing a cross-attention mechanism that localizes objects from action locations and vice versa by predicting displacements between them, referred to as relational directions. During training, we estimate the relational directions as ones maximizing the scores of ground-truth interactions that guide predictions toward compatible action-object regions. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we improve the state of the art by 2.6% mAP score and 5.8% recall score on HICO and Visual Genome datasets, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/hbdat/iccv21_relational_direction.

-    In a typical multi-label setting, a picture contains on average few positive labels, and many negative ones. This positive-negative imbalance dominates the optimization process, and can lead to under-emphasizing gradients from positive labels during training, resulting in poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel asymmetric loss (""ASL""), which operates differently on positive and negative samples. The loss enables to dynamically down-weights and hard-thresholds easy negative samples, while also discarding possibly mislabeled samples. We demonstrate how ASL can balance the probabilities of different samples, and how this balancing is translated to better mAP scores. With ASL, we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple popular multi-label datasets: MS-COCO, Pascal-VOC, NUS-WIDE and Open Images. We also demonstrate ASL applicability for other tasks, such as single-label classification and object detection. ASL is effective, easy to implement, and does not increase the training time or complexity. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ASL.

-    We tackle object category discovery, which is the problem of discovering and localizing novel objects in a large unlabeled dataset. While existing methods show results on datasets with less cluttered scenes and fewer object instances per image, we present our results on the challenging COCO dataset. Moreover, we argue that, rather than discovering new categories from scratch, discovery algorithms can benefit from identifying what is already known and focusing their attention on the unknown. We propose a method that exploits prior knowledge about certain object types to discover new categories by leveraging two memory modules, namely Working and Semantic memory. We show the performance of our detector on the COCO minival dataset to demonstrate its in-the-wild capabilities.

-    Deep learning-based methods for video pedestrian detection and tracking require large volumes of training data to achieve good performance. However, data acquisition in crowded public environments raises data privacy concerns -- we are not allowed to simply record and store data without the explicit consent of all participants. Furthermore, the annotation of such data for computer vision applications usually requires a substantial amount of manual effort, especially in the video domain. Labeling instances of pedestrians in highly crowded scenarios can be challenging even for human annotators and may introduce errors in the training data. In this paper, we study how we can advance different aspects of multi-person tracking using solely synthetic data. To this end, we generate MOTSynth, a large, highly diverse synthetic dataset for object detection and tracking using a rendering game engine. Our experiments show that MOTSynth can be used as a replacement for real data on tasks such as pedestrian detection, re-identification, segmentation, and tracking.

-    Capsule Networks (CapsNets) create internal representations by parsing inputs into various instances at different resolution levels via a two-phase process -- part-whole transformation and hierarchical component routing. Since both of these internal phases are computationally expensive, CapsNets have not found wider use. Existing variations of CapsNets mainly focus on performance comparison with the original CapsNet, and have not outperformed CNN-based models on complex tasks. To address the limitations of the existing CapsNet structures, we propose a novel Prediction-Tuning Capsule Network (PT-CapsNet), and also introduce fully connected PT-Capsules (FC-PT-Caps) and locally connected PT-Capsules (LC-PT-Caps). Different from existing CapsNet structures, our proposed model (i) allows the use of capsules for more difficult vision tasks and provides wider applicability; and (ii) provides better than or comparable performance to CNN-based baselines on these complex tasks. In our experiments, we show robustness to affine transformations, as well as the lightweight and scalability of PT-CapsNet via constructing larger and deeper networks and performing comparisons on classification, semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. The results show consistent performance improvement and significant parameter reduction compared to various baseline models. Code is available at https://github.com/Christinepan881/PT-CapsNet.git.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Joung_Learning_Canonical_3D_Object_Representation_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    We propose a novel framework for fine-grained object recognition that learns to recover object variation in 3D space from a single image, trained on an image collection without using any ground-truth 3D annotation. We accomplish this by representing an object as a composition of 3D shape and its appearance, while eliminating the effect of camera viewpoint, in a canonical configuration. Unlike conventional methods modeling spatial variation in 2D images only, our method is capable of reconfiguring the appearance feature in a canonical 3D space, thus enabling the subsequent object classifier to be invariant under 3D geometric variation. Our representation also allows us to go beyond existing methods, by incorporating 3D shape variation as an additional cue for object recognition. To learn the model without ground-truth 3D annotation, we deploy a differentiable renderer in an analysis-by-synthesis framework. By incorporating 3D shape and appearance jointly in a deep representation, our method learns the discriminative representation of the object and achieves competitive performance on fine-grained image recognition and vehicle re-identification. We also demonstrate that the performance of 3D shape reconstruction is improved by learning fine-grained shape deformation in a boosting manner.

-    We present a novel pyramidal output representation to ensure parsimony with our "specialize and fuse" process for semantic segmentation. A pyramidal "output" representation consists of coarse-to-fine levels, where each level is "specialize" in a different class distribution (e.g., more stuff than things classes at coarser levels). Two types of pyramidal outputs (i.e., unity and semantic pyramid) are "fused" into the final semantic output, where the unity pyramid indicates unity-cells (i.e., all pixels in such cell share the same semantic label). The process ensures parsimony by predicting a relatively small number of labels for unity-cells (e.g., a large cell of grass) to build the final semantic output. In addition to the "output" representation, we design a coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate the "features" representation from different levels. We validate the effectiveness of each key module in our method through comprehensive ablation studies. Finally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used semantic segmentation datasets---ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal-Context.

-    Visual storytelling and story comprehension are uniquely human skills that play a central role in how we learn about and experience the world. Despite remarkable progress in recent years in synthesis of visual and textual content in isolation and learning effective joint visual-linguistic representations, existing systems still operate only at a superficial, factual level. With the goal of developing systems that are able to comprehend rich human-generated narratives, and co-create new stories, we introduce AESOP: a new dataset that captures the creative process associated with visual storytelling. Visual panels are composed of clip-art objects with specific attributes enabling a broad range of creative expression. Using AESOP, we propose foundational storytelling tasks that are generative variants of story cloze tests, to better measure the creative and causal reasoning ability required for visual storytelling. We further develop a generalized story completion framework that models stories as the co-evolution of visual and textual concepts. We benchmark the proposed approach with human baselines and evaluate using comprehensive qualitative and quantitative metrics. Our results highlight key insights related to the dataset, modelling and evaluation of visual storytelling for future research in this promising field of study.

-    Being able to learn dense semantic representations of images without supervision is an important problem in computer vision. However, despite its significance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions that considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with a narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the problem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised case. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an unsupervised manner. Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised setting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on such a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over strong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The code is available.

-    Existing salient object detection (SOD) models usually focus on either backbone feature extractors or saliency heads, ignoring their relations. A powerful backbone could still achieve sub-optimal performance with a weak saliency head and vice versa. Moreover, the balance between model performance and inference latency poses a great challenge to model design, especially when considering different deployment scenarios. Considering all components in an integral neural architecture search (iNAS) space, we propose a flexible device-aware search scheme that only trains the SOD model once and quickly finds high-performance but low-latency models on multiple devices. An evolution search with latency-group sampling (LGS) is proposed to explore the entire latency area of our enlarged search space. Models searched by iNAS achieve similar performance with SOTA methods but reduce the 3.8x, 3.3x, 2.6x, 1.9x latency on Huawei Nova6 SE, Intel Core CPU, the Jetson Nano, and Nvidia Titan Xp.

-    We present a flexible and high-performance framework, named Pyramid R-CNN, for two-stage 3D object detection from point clouds. Current approaches generally rely on the points or voxels of interest for RoI feature extraction on the second stage, but cannot effectively handle the sparsity and non-uniform distribution of those points, and this may result in failures in detecting objects that are far away. To resolve the problems, we propose a novel second-stage module, named pyramid RoI head, to adaptively learn the features from the sparse points of interest. The pyramid RoI head consists of three key components. Firstly, we propose the RoI-grid Pyramid, which addresses the sparsity problem by extensively collecting points of interest for each RoI in a pyramid manner. Secondly, we propose RoI-grid Attention, a new operation that can encode richer information from sparse points by incorporating conventional attention-based and graph-based point operators into a unified formulation. Thirdly, we propose the Density-Aware Radius Prediction (DARP) module, which can adapt to different point density levels by dynamically adjusting the focusing range of RoIs. Combining the three components, our pyramid RoI head is robust to the sparse and imbalanced circumstances, and can be applied upon various 3D backbones to consistently boost the detection performance. Extensive experiments show that Pyramid R-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D detection models by a large margin on both the KITTI dataset and the Waymo Open dataset.

-    The point cloud representation of an object can have a large geometric variation in view of inconsistent data acquisition procedure, which thus leads to domain discrepancy due to diverse and uncontrollable shape representation cross datasets. To improve discrimination on unseen distribution of point-based geometries in a practical and feasible perspective, this paper proposes a new method of geometry-aware self-training (GAST) for unsupervised domain adaptation of object point cloud classification. Specifically, this paper aims to learn a domain-shared representation of semantic categories, via two novel self-supervised geometric learning tasks as feature regularization. On one hand, the representation learning is empowered by a linear mixup of point cloud samples with their self-generated rotation labels, to capture a global topological configuration of local geometries. On the other hand, a diverse point distribution across datasets can be normalized with a novel curvature-aware distortion localization. Experiments on the PointDA-10 dataset show that our GAST method can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

-    While deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, they often fail to generalize to subtle variations of input images. Several defenses have been proposed to improve the robustness against these variations. However, current defenses can only withstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain vulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade performance of the model on clean images. In this paper, we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach to simultaneously improve the model's generalization and robustness to unseen adversarial attacks. Instead of altering a single pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a spectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models with a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples enable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of input alterations during training. We show that our approach not only improves performance of the model on clean images but also makes it robust against unforeseen attacks and outperforms prior work. We validate effectiveness of our method by demonstrating results on various tasks such as classification, semantic segmentation and object detection.

-    Transformer-based detector is a new paradigm in object detection, which aims to achieve pretty-well performance while eliminates the priori knowledge driven components, e.g., anchors, proposals and the NMS. DETR, the state-of-the-art model among them, is composed of three sub-modules, i.e., a CNN-based backbone and paired transformer encoder-decoder. The CNN is applied to extract local features and the transformer is used to capture global contexts. This pipeline, however, is not concise enough. In this paper, we propose WB-DETR (DETR-based detector Without Backbone) to prove that the reliance on CNN features extraction for a transformer-based detector is not necessary. Unlike the original DETR, WB-DETR is composed of only an encoder and a decoder without CNN backbone. For an input image, WB-DETR serializes it directly to encode the local features into each individual token. To make up the deficiency of transformer in modeling local information, we design an LIE-T2T (local information enhancement tokens to token) module to enhance the internal information of tokens after unfolding. Experimental results demonstrate that WB-DETR, the first pure-transformer detector without CNN to our knowledge, yields on par accuracy and faster inference speed with only half number of parameters compared with DETR baseline.

-    We propose Rank & Sort (RS) Loss, a ranking-based loss function to train deep object detection and instance segmentation methods (i.e. visual detectors). RS Loss supervises the classifier, a sub-network of these methods, to rank each positive above all negatives as well as to sort positives among themselves with respect to (wrt.) their localisation qualities (e.g. Intersection-over-Union - IoU). To tackle the non-differentiable nature of ranking and sorting, we reformulate the incorporation of error-driven update with backpropagation as Identity Update, which enables us to model our novel sorting error among positives. With RS Loss, we significantly simplify training: (i) Thanks to our sorting objective, the positives are prioritized by the classifier without an additional auxiliary head (e.g. for centerness, IoU, mask-IoU), (ii) due to its ranking-based nature, RS Loss is robust to class imbalance, and thus, no sampling heuristic is required, and (iii) we address the multi-task nature of visual detectors using tuning-free task-balancing coefficients. Using RS Loss, we train seven diverse visual detectors only by tuning the learning rate, and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: e.g. our RS Loss improves (i) Faster R-CNN by  3 box AP and aLRP Loss (ranking-based baseline) by  2 box AP on COCO dataset, (ii) Mask R-CNN with repeat factor sampling (RFS) by 3.5 mask AP ( 7 AP for rare classes) on LVIS dataset; and also outperforms all counterparts.

-    Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) relieves the reliance on large-scale annotated data by transferring the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to a new unlabeled target domain. Recent DAOD approaches resort to local feature alignment in virtue of domain adversarial training in conjunction with the ad-hoc detection pipelines to achieve feature adaptation. However, these methods are limited to adapt the specific types of object detectors and do not explore the cross-domain topological relations. In this paper, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set domain adaptation problem in which foregrounds (pixel or region) can be seen as the "known class", while backgrounds (pixel or region) are referred to as the "unknown class". To this end, we present a new and general perspective for DAOD named Dual Bipartite Graph Learning (DBGL), which captures the cross-domain interactions on both pixel-level and semantic-level via increasing the distinction between foregrounds and backgrounds and modeling the cross-domain dependencies among different semantic categories. Experiments reveal that the proposed DBGL in conjunction with one-stage and two-stage detectors exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on standard DAOD benchmarks.

- [link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wu_Visual_Transformers_Where_Do_Transformers_Really_Belong_in_Vision_Models_ICCV_2021_paper.html)
-    A recent trend in computer vision is to replace convolutions with transformers. However, the performance gain of transformers is attained at a steep cost, requiring GPU years and hundreds of millions of samples for training. This excessive resource usage compensates for a misuse of transformers: Transformers densely model relationships between its inputs -- ideal for late stages of a neural network, when concepts are sparse and spatially-distant, but extremely inefficient for early stages of a network, when patterns are redundant and localized. To address these issues, we leverage the respective strengths of both operations, building convolution-transformer hybrids. Critically, in sharp contrast to pixel-space transformers, our Visual Transformer (VT) operates in a semantic token space, judiciously attending to different image parts based on context. Our VTs significantly outperforms baselines: On ImageNet, our VT-ResNets outperform convolution-only ResNet by 4.6 to 7 points and transformer-only ViT-B by 2.6 points with 2.5 times fewer FLOPs, 2.1 times fewer parameters. For semantic segmentation on LIP and COCO-stuff, VT-based feature pyramid networks (FPN) achieve 0.35 points higher mIoU while reducing the FPN module's FLOPs by 6.5x.

-    Recent progress in 3D object detection from single images leverages monocular depth estimation as a way to produce 3D pointclouds, turning cameras into pseudo-lidar sensors. These two-stage detectors improve with the accuracy of the intermediate depth estimation network, which can itself be improved without manual labels via large-scale self-supervised learning. However, they tend to suffer from overfitting more than end-to-end methods, are more complex, and the gap with similar lidar-based detectors remains significant. In this work, we propose an end-to-end, single stage, monocular 3D object detector, DD3D, that can benefit from depth pre-training like pseudo-lidar methods, but without their limitations. Our architecture is designed for effective information transfer between depth estimation and 3D detection, allowing us to scale with the amount of unlabeled pre-training data. Our method achieves state-of-theart results on two challenging benchmarks, with 16.34% and 9.28% AP for Cars and Pedestrians (respectively) on the KITTI-3D benchmark, and 41.5% mAP on NuScenes.

-    Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when given image category labels but requires to learn object localization models. Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent, causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM counterparts by7.1%/27.1%for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

-    Monocular 3D object detection is of great significance for autonomous driving but remains challenging. The core challenge is to predict the distance of objects in the absence of explicit depth information. Unlike regressing the distance as a single variable in most existing methods, we propose a novel geometry-based distance decomposition to recover the distance by its factors. The decomposition factors the distance of objects into the most representative and stable variables, i.e. the physical height and the projected visual height in the image plane. Moreover, the decomposition maintains the self-consistency between the two heights, leading to robust distance prediction when both predicted heights are inaccurate. The decomposition also enables us to trace the causes of the distance uncertainty for different scenarios. Such decomposition makes the distance prediction interpretable, accurate, and robust. Our method directly predicts 3D bounding boxes from RGB images with a compact architecture, making the training and inference simple and efficient. The experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the monocular 3D Object Detection and Bird's Eye View tasks of the KITTI dataset, and can generalize to images with different camera intrinsics.

-    Image hiding aims to hide a secret image into a cover image in an imperceptible way, and then recover the secret image perfectly at the receiver end. Capacity, invisibility and security are three primary challenges in image hiding task. This paper proposes a novel invertible neural network (INN) based framework, HiNet, to simultaneously overcome the three challenges in image hiding. For large capacity, we propose an inverse learning mechanism by simultaneously learning the image concealing and revealing processes. Our method is able to achieve the concealing of a full-size secret image into a cover image with the same size. For high invisibility, instead of pixel domain hiding, we propose to hide the secret information in wavelet domain. Furthermore, we propose a new low-frequency wavelet loss to constrain that secret information is hidden in high-frequency wavelet sub-bands, which significantly improves the hiding security. Experimental results show that our HiNet significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art image hiding methods, with more than 10 dB PSNR improvement in secret image recovery on ImageNet, COCO and DIV2K datasets.

-    Co-occurrent visual pattern makes aggregating contextual information a common paradigm to enhance the pixel representation for semantic image segmentation. The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of the whole image, i.e., aggregating the image-level contextual information. Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual information. To address this, this paper proposes to augment the pixel representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second, we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this paper to report state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, LIP, COCOStuff and Cityscapes.

-    Lane detection is a key task for autonomous driving vehicles. Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection. Through experiments, we find that existing active learning methods perform poorly for lane detection, and the reasons are twofold. On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model. We show that the proposed uncertainty metric overcomes the above two problems. To reduce data redundancy, we explore the influence sets of image samples, and propose a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally we incorporate the uncertainty and diversity metrics, and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. The experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art on the lane detection benchmarks. In addition, we extend this method to common 2D object detection and the results show that it is also effective.

-    Current state-of-the-art two-stage detectors generate oriented proposals through time-consuming schemes. This diminishes the detectors' speed, thereby becoming the computational bottleneck in advanced oriented object detection systems. This work proposes an effective and simple oriented object detection framework, termed Oriented R-CNN, which is a general two-stage oriented detector with promising accuracy and efficiency. To be specific, in the first stage, we propose an oriented Region Proposal Network (oriented RPN) that directly generates high-quality oriented proposals in a nearly cost-free manner. The second stage is oriented R-CNN head for refining oriented Regions of Interest (oriented RoIs) and recognizing them. Without tricks, oriented R-CNN with ResNet50 achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy on two commonly-used datasets for oriented object detection including DOTA (75.87% mAP) and HRSC2016 (96.50% mAP), while having a speed of 15.1 FPS with the image size of 1024x1024 on a single RTX 2080Ti. We hope our work could inspire rethinking the design of oriented detectors and serve as a baseline for oriented object detection.
